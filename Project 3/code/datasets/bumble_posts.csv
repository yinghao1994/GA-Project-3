,Bumble,"I fully acknowledge that this is likely going to be removed before too many read it but here goes. 

First and foremost, I will not out anyone - don't ask, she clearly has enough going on in her life that she doesn't need anyone else. 

Secondly, this mod isn't a mod here. If she is a mod here, well, this will be super short lived. 

**tl;dr** Met a woman through OLD, turns out she's a mod for few different subs, she has *at least* fifteen alts that she uses to argue with herself, and she (as a mod) thinks she's some relationship guru. 

So this all started back in January in a pretty depressing time of my life - holiday funk, death in the family, recent breakup, moved to a new town, ... Shitsville. So to meet some new people in my new city I installed them all. I wasn't picky or really looking for anything in particular so I just swiped on pretty much anyone that didn't seem crazy. One of my first matches WITH REPLY came from a woman about my age (30's) who wasn't my usual type. I probably wasn't hers but we clicked. We really did. She was fun and entertaining and we continued to chat for almost the past four months straight. 

Then she started to slip about a month ago. Instead of simple disagreements, things became really disproportionate in their reactions. For example, I asked her what she thought about sexting. I didn't ask if she wanted to but just what she thought. It was so innocent in context that I could have sent the whole discussion to my mother without blushing. The reply had to take her an hour to finger out. It was a full out rant.  

So I avoided anything on the topic of sex for the next few days, maybe a week, and did so until she brought it up again. After all, she wasn't really my type physically but at this point, who knew what could happen. Worst case I found a friend in life, best case I found my best friend. Anyways, I quickly discovered that I had opened Pandora's box after that. I would get random texts about relationship stuff at all hours of the day. Some sex, some not, all really off. Not really asking me but telling me her thoughts on these random scenarios. Something definitely triggered her. It was as if there was a random relationships topic generator and I was on the receiving end. 

Being a single guy on Reddit, I too read relationship subs from time-to-time but I have never told anyone. I didn't even tell her that I knew what Reddit was. Especially not these relationship or dating subs. Also, the relationship subs really aren't my cup of tea, they are entertaining here and there but really only when I'm out of everything else. So there I am one day reading some innocent post on a pretty popular relationship sub scrolling through the comments and one catches my eye. It's almost verbatim what she had told me only a few moments prior. So I click on the profile and it's full of the same stuff she'll randomly send me. I get only about 5% of what she's been posting and commenting but that 5% is verbatim. Odd. 

So I dig a little further and go down some of the history of this user and discover that she's been replying to others who were using my quotes???? What is going on??  Stuff like Reddit user A quotes me, and she, with this alt, is now replying to user A who is clearly her... And there are tons of them! I read the sub and go through some of the smaller ones and there I am all over the place. My stories that I shared with her are there, and in those comments she's replying to them with different alts just as she had to me. She's holding full-blown conversations with herself through the use of at least fifteen alts!  

But here's the crazy part, as if having alts to talk to and argue with isn't crazy enough, it's that she really believes that she's some relationship guru. She's the main mod (active wise) in quite a few of them and even her alts are mods.  Preaching about her experiences, her ""degrees"", and even posting just to be the white knight. 

(I know they are all hers and she's not 'talking to anyone about them then her friends post' because of the timing of them all and the way they are phrased. Too many coincidences to ignore.  

I obviously dropped her at this point because I felt more like my comments are just being used for her Reddit personalities but before I did, I tried to understand where she's coming from and why on earth anyone would do this. I've come to the conclusion that she's just fucking nuts. Like certifiable fucking nuts and there's nothing that, even me, the guy who is ""million times out of her league"" (not bragging, just for perspective), couldn't stop her from being. Even when I asked her about it, (she still deserved a proper good bye instead of ghosting) she just blew it all off for a day or two. I was about to delete it all and forget it when I got a long multi-part text from her. It had it all from ptsd to victimizing to ""all guys are trash"". The next day, she was right back at it with at least six of her alts. Literally hours of her day every day.  

I guess what I find more alarming is that her comments and even ""powers"" as a mod influence so many here.

,Bumble,"Last year towards the end of December, I downloaded bumble for the second time in my life. I didn’t have much success the first time and deleted it, but I decided to give it another go—and I am so grateful I did. 

After not having much success with the first few matches, I finally matched with the one. As the girl, I always try to make my reach out entertaining because I know how it feels to just get a “hey” and not much conversation can stem from that. He was the first guy to be appreciative of my reach out and overall not boring with conversing, and I was so very appreciative of that. 

After talking for many months, we finally met, and on our second date he asked me to be his girlfriend! I ended up crying of excitement because I had never been asked that before.

&lt;p&gt;After not having much success with the first few matches, I finally matched with the one. As the girl, I always try to make my reach out entertaining because I know how it feels to just get a “hey” and not much conversation can stem from that. He was the first guy to be appreciative of my reach out and overall not boring with conversing, and I was so very appreciative of that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After talking for many months, we finally met, and on our second date he asked me to be his girlfriend! I ended up crying of excitement because I had never been asked that before.

,Bumble,"Alright, this is a long and complicated story but I promise it’s worth the read. It’s juicy, it’s shameless, and it’s filled with a lot of “I swear I can’t make this shit up moments”. This is the story of 3 times I met a girl off BumbleBFF, only to ultimately have the friendship come crashing down all within a 6 month time frame cuz I can’t seem to have low drama, healthy, platonic friendships. 

So I thought I’d try bumble BFF after hosting a party that turned into being a sausage fest cuz I realized most my friends are dudes (I’m a female). 

Friend #1: invited her over for a wine night at mine and of course the dumb bitch brings her boyfriend cuz she can’t do anything by herself. 
She was quite abrasive and annoying and didn’t contribute much to the convo but I totally hit it off with her boyfriend. Flash forward 3 months after the three of us forming a tight knit friend group that combined our other friend groups and they break up and I start secretly seeing the boyfriend after we confessed feelings. She finds out and to this day (5 months later) still harasses me on Instagram. He has a new gf and I’ve moved on, but she’s still salty about it. Whatever, best dick I got in a while tbh. 

Friend #2: invited her to a party after matching and of course, dumb bitch has to bring her boyfriend. She’s pretty cool but I’m getting unexplainable crazy bitch vibes. One day she starts to talk about how she is in an open relationship with her boyfriend. I’m getting excited cuz I’m thinking she’s flirting with me but then (insert record scratch) she asks me if I would be interested in fucking her boyfriend who she lived with. A part of me was intrigued but most of me had the feeling that he had underwhelming dicking down game. Immediately I think it’s a trap because she knew what had happened with the last girl and was trying to get me to say I’d fuck her boyfriend. So I said I wasn’t into him. A couple weeks go by and she hits me up again with another request; to have a threesome with this 34 year old guy who was fucking on the side. I was about to move to Florida and riding the high of quitting my job and saying fuck it and agreed to do it. So her and I (both 20) tag team this sexy divorcee engineer guy and it was super hot. 

Shit you not, I happened to run into him again in Florida just a few weeks after that happened while I was on my way from Tampa to Miami. She found out I saw him and got territorial over A SIDE HOE that we both fucked and blocked me on everything. Oh well, she was fucking crazy but I do miss our sexcapades. 

Lastly, I give you 

Friend #3: I met her while I was solo traveling through Tampa. She was 21, he was 27. They lived in a leasing office that was converted into a tiny apartment that was attached to their building her dad owned. She was a raging liberal (which i loved) with super strange contrasting views. Everything about her personality was magnetic. And they were both raging alcoholics. Like everybody in Florida is an alcoholic but they were like next level. Shortly after matching, she invited me over to drink white claws with her and her husband. 
I get there and we are instantly vibing and exchanging crazy stories. About an hour into hanging out her boyfriend grabs my face and starts making out with me. I go along with it cuz once again I was in a fuck it mentality. I ended up spending a week living with them until the girl decides she is a lesbian and in love with me and wants to get a divorce. Her husband was being such an emotional bitch boy and wouldn’t let us go out to a club alone. So we agree to all go to the club together with the secret intent of ditching him in the club and running away for a couple days. In order to buy time, I convinced this super weird Czech guy who looks like he didn’t have eyebrows to meet us in the club to distract the husband while we ditched them. I decided he was the perfect candidate after he went on for about an hour about how he has a saltine fetish. Yes, you heard that right, a fucking saltine fetish!!! We get into the club “The Castle” in Ybor City, which was basically filled with creepy predators in speedos, little bitch boy subs/simps, and the type of girls who identified as wolves in middle school and hissed at people when you tried to talk to them. Plus size chicks in leather galore. I’m not shaming, just painting the picture. 

Anyways, we tell them we’re going to the bathroom to fuck each other and bolt out of the club. We ended up going to the dudes place that they use to have group sex with who happened to be up at 4 am for work (he was in the military). We ask if we can sleep at his place to get away from the over emotional mess that was her husband and he let us just crash at his place while he was at work. His weird roommate/husband (he was straight but married him for military housing benefits) was there and I saw him come out of his room once with a python wrapped around his wrist. I honestly can’t make this shit up. 
Nonchalantly he gives us the password to the WiFi and tells us he will back at 1 and is down to go get dinner later. We finally get to sleep after pulling a 3 day bender. 

After spending another week with this chick trying to get her to sober up, she ends up getting back with her husband and kicks me out of her lil studio apartment. I was more or less living out of my station wagon after quitting my job and trying to start a new life in Florida. 
Ultimately, as much fun as she was to hang with and play with, she was fucking psycho and Tampa was gross so I hit the road to the Key West. Her husband still hits me up black out drunk occasionally saying how he wants to hate fuck me. I really should block him but it’s quality entertainment, he’s such a pathetic simp. 

All in all, I don’t talk to either 3 girls, but ironically, I am still friends with friend #1s ex boyfriends ex girlfriend and on decent terms with the ex boyfriend who I started seeing behind her back. As for friend #2, I occasionally talk to the side hoe who we tag teamed. And as for friend #3, I talk to the guy who let us crash at his place almost every day, and occasionally Snapchat some of the random girls we (friend #3) met from inviting random people to come drink on the beach with us. We actually started a group chat called the coochie cult where we could just whore out in. Unfortunately when she got back with her simp, the group dissolved, kinda miss those hoes tbh. Sometimes I think about saltine guy, and his weird collection of religious memorabilia. That guy was so fucking weird. 

So there you have it folks, you can make friends on bumble bff, just try not to fuck them, their boyfriend, their side hoe, their husband or their friends.",t2_6f7i7r0h,False,,0,False,"Dear future bumbleBFF match: for the sake of your relationship pls leave your boyfriend at home.

It’s juicy, it’s shameless, and it’s filled with a lot of “I swear I can’t make this shit up moments”. This is the story of 3 times I met a girl off BumbleBFF, only to ultimately have the friendship come crashing down all within a 6 month time frame cuz I can’t seem to have low drama, healthy, platonic friendships. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I thought I’d try bumble BFF after hosting a party that turned into being a sausage fest cuz I realized most my friends are dudes (I’m a female). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friend #1: invited her over for a wine night at mine and of course the dumb bitch brings her boyfriend cuz she can’t do anything by herself. 
She was quite abrasive and annoying and didn’t contribute much to the convo but I totally hit it off with her boyfriend. Flash forward 3 months after the three of us forming a tight knit friend group that combined our other friend groups and they break up and I start secretly seeing the boyfriend after we confessed feelings. She finds out and to this day (5 months later) still harasses me on Instagram. He has a new gf and I’ve moved on, but she’s still salty about it. Whatever, best dick I got in a while tbh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friend #2: invited her to a party after matching and of course, dumb bitch has to bring her boyfriend. She’s pretty cool but I’m getting unexplainable crazy bitch vibes. One day she starts to talk about how she is in an open relationship with her boyfriend. I’m getting excited cuz I’m thinking she’s flirting with me but then (insert record scratch) she asks me if I would be interested in fucking her boyfriend who she lived with. A part of me was intrigued but most of me had the feeling that he had underwhelming dicking down game. Immediately I think it’s a trap because she knew what had happened with the last girl and was trying to get me to say I’d fuck her boyfriend. So I said I wasn’t into him. A couple weeks go by and she hits me up again with another request; to have a threesome with this 34 year old guy who was fucking on the side. I was about to move to Florida and riding the high of quitting my job and saying fuck it and agreed to do it. So her and I (both 20) tag team this sexy divorcee engineer guy and it was super hot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shit you not, I happened to run into him again in Florida just a few weeks after that happened while I was on my way from Tampa to Miami. She found out I saw him and got territorial over A SIDE HOE that we both fucked and blocked me on everything. Oh well, she was fucking crazy but I do miss our sexcapades. &lt;/p&gt;

,Bumble,"So I downloaded the Bumble app for the friends feature, but when I read about the women message first feature I tried the date section aswell.

But man oh man is it useless; I literally have been using it for less then a day and got 3 matches, of which all of them just send “Hey”. Like, what do they expect from me? Do they want me to start a conversation going of just the bland ass profiles with only selfies? And it’s not the case that I have nothing on my profile; I have interests, pictures of festivals I attended etc.

And no, I don’t mind starting conversation, I have done so on Tinder. But come on, what’s up with these double standards. A “Hey” normally isn’t enough, but when women start the conversation it is?

Edit:
Just to clarify a few things, this Thread isn’t about women having to be interesting on “swiping apps”. The “problem” I have with the feature that lets women message first is that it’s kind of pointless if women just send “Hey”. You have already swiped right on someone because you are interested, so just by saying hello in essence you swipe right twice.

,Bumble,"Ah, ghosting - what a fun quarantine activity.

Intellectually, I know ghosting comes with the territory. But it doesn’t make it suck any less. 

Short version, I’m a gal in my 30s, and he’s also in his 30s, both verified. Spent a couple nights messaging back and forth on the app. Tons in common. Equal reciprocation of depth in the conversation, him asking a lot of questions about me. After a few days of awesome conversation, I cop that it might be a bit direct and asked for his number. I say if he’s not down for that, totally fine! No response required.

He replies with enthusiasm. Says he will definitely text me later on that night and he does! Also says he likes me being direct so “keep it up :)”

So then we text for a few nights. Again pretty late, lots of depth, a ton in common, feels super positive. He’s asking lots of questions about me and I do the same. We both say when things are over we should definitely grab drinks. 

Finally I decide to offer up the idea of a virtual happy hour after about a week of that. 

I text that I have a question for him. I see him start to reply - he was always prompt in replying or texting - but my follow up asking for a virtual hang got sent first - I didn’t want to chicken out.

And then... nothing. Not a word, no reply.

Finally three days later I say that whoops I guess that was too direct and If it was, I’m sorry. I thank him for the really great conversations. 

I end the super short message saying that he should feel no pressure to respond truly and that I hoped he was having a good week.

And still nothing. 

But he also hasn’t unmatched me.

Based on the level of fun we were having mutually, the escalation, and the fact that he was fine exchanging numbers and saying yes to meeting up... although who knows maybe I’m wrong. It just seemed like a strange spot to ghost. 

I wish I could ask but that would be pointless and weird I’m sure since I already basically sent the “bye” text.

So far it&amp;#39;s worked for me but I&amp;#39;ve seen some people view it as a red flag. Have I just been lucky these few times? I wanna know if I&amp;#39;m doing something wrong here.&lt;/p&gt;

* Wash your face with [facial cleanser](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/gf94a1/giving_advice_hygiene_suggestions_to_better/fpuwwsb?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) (which is hydrating), not body soap (which is drying), and pat dry.  Men need to care for their faces as much as women do!  (*ETA link to 4 suggested cleansers*)
* Use a toner on oily areas and/or open pores (especially the nose). *ETA witchhazel can be applied with a cottonball a couple times a week as a toner after facial cleansing*.
* Use a moisturizer, preferably with SPF if going outside.  Cancer isn't specific to any gender.
* Use lip balm to condition and protect your lips.  [Burt's Bees](https://www.burtsbees.com/lip-care/lip-balm/) is great, the one in [the tin](https://www.burtsbees.com/product/beeswax-lip-balm-tin/10999-00.html) is my fav.  Avoid petroleum based products.
* Shave in the same direction as the growth of the hair, and soften your facial hair before shaving it to prevent ingrowths and nicks.
* If you have a beard, take care of it because well-groomed beards are sexy!   [This webpage](https://www.mensxp.com/grooming/beards-and-shaving.html) has links to various helps for patchy beards, full beards, etc.
* Cut and file your nails regularly.  Keep lotion by the sink to moisturize after hand washing.
* SHOWER!  Before bed gets rid of outside allergens; quick one when you wake so you're fresh for your day and can easily style your hair/beard; after the gym/workout; before an event (party, date, etc).
* Clean your ears!
* Check for stray hairs: ears, nose, eyebrows.
* Keep your head hair clean and trimmed; no greasy or straggly hair.
* Wear well-fitting clothes.  If you're a large, don't drown yourself in a 3x t-shirt; likewise don't try to cram into a medium if you're a large.  When going on a date, leave the clothing with writing on it at home.
* Wear **clean**, good condition shoes; polish dress shoes to remove scuffs.  You can [clean sneaker soles](https://youtu.be/hzePuTLDeaM?t=45) with toothpaste or baking soda.  If you clean them when you get home before putting away they're ready if you need to leave at a a moment's notice.    
Use [foot powder](https://www.goldbond.com/blog/product/maximum-strength-medicated-foot-powder/) on your feet to keep your shoes and feet from smelling bad.
* Smelly feet? That usually means bacteria or infection.  Soak them for about an hour in epsom salts to soothe and soften, add about a cup of cheap antiseptic mouthwash or white vinegar to every quart of water to kill the bacteria; scrub your feet to remove dead skin and **dry feet thoroughly**.    
If you have yellow toenails or especially smelly feet: after your foot soak, before bed use Vick's vapor rub on your toenails and toes then cover with cotton socks; this will help prevent nail fungus.
* Wear anti-perspirant or deodorant (these do different things! Select the right one for you).  If you also want to wear cologne, get the matching deodorant scent; don't mix and match different scents.  Wear an undershirt if you tend to sweat a lot.    
**Never ever** try to disguise body odor with cologne.
* Brush and floss teeth, especially before bed!  Use an [anticavity mouthwash](https://www.actoralcare.com/products/act-restoring/) and don't eat or drink (except water) after preparing for bed.  [Plackers](https://www.plackers.com) make flossing easy!  Tooth care is extremely important and is the most important to me.

We all have things going on in our lives that prevent us from reaching out and the longer it persists, the harder it is to get back in touch.

If you\'re still interested in talking but it\'s too overwhelming to respond at the moment, you can send \\[a dot/an emoji/one word response/etc.\\] then we can continue this conversation whenever you feel like it.

1) When you start off on Tinder and you start to get some likes why does Tinder have a habit of showing you to people outside of your preference when there’s girls like less than 2km?? No one wants to see 100 likes all from people over 50km away 🤬.

2) Both apps like to blur photos but also expect you to pay for the service, surely it seems more fair showing you their pictures and distance but not their names so you know what you’re paying for... don’t you think it’s a bit scammy wanting your money and not telling you exactly what you’re getting for it?

3) Do you believe that bumble and tinder show you people who have already swiped left on you? Defeats the purpose of showing you anyone you have 0% chance of matching with.

4) Has anyone else who’s in shape, got a good figure, workout abs whatever noticed that you seem to get more likes from bigger girls who you just aren’t interested in? It’s like bumble and tinder seem to believe in shape guys only like fat chicks? 

5) Do you believe that tinder should be more transparent in their modelling of the app for example giving you a list of girls who have left swiped you so you can compare your own match rate.

,Bumble,"Ok, so, obviously hitting it off is just something that I believed was happening... 

I'm a female, mid 20s, matched with a cool guy 10 years older. We'd been talking a month. He asked me out but he lives north in my city (alone), and I'm south (with parents). It didn't sound like he was willing to budge; I considered going over (!) but it seemed way too risky/not reciprocal. He definitely led with more sexual energy, I guess also a bit romantic. Our communication style was not quite matching, but there was still enough personal interest we were cultivating IMO. We voice noted but never video called or nothing, just didn't seem natural to ask. I fancied him like crazy, was rather charming as a flirting style and he seemed to love it. He wasn't as proactive  when it came to initiation but would respond in kind, with messages which showed effort and were cute. It's not good enough, but I reasoned I was also distracted as I'm wfh. 

Last night I asked him what we're going to do with lockdown continuing, and he straight up said ""guess we'll just end what never started"" and said how crazy long 6 months is, when i suggested I'd like to revisit meeting up later. I left him on read. 

Now I wasn't expecting a full blown ting, I've continued chatting with other people, and I know this time I did put the cart before the horse. But I just wondered, even if sex/romance isn't on the table, why was this guy such a downer! I know a month isn't a long time, but there was a decent mutual back and forth. I haven't had that with many people online in all my years of ODing, let alone just during this year. 

I guess there's nothing I can do to save this one, which is a bummer. Has anyone had similar experiences, esp in midst of COVID-19?

Around Wednesday is when I finally got her number and we began chatting through text. I tried messaging her again around Thursday night but no response until Friday.

I tried sending one last message last night to see what the reaction would be and didn’t get a response until this morning. She said that she wasn’t sure that she wanted to keep talking with me since she wanted to use the quarantine to “focus on herself”. We had a small back and forth where she said that the pandemic makes it hard to communicate with someone and that now was a strange time to be talking to a match. I just said I understood her points and hoped we could begin talking again in the future. Now, here’s the caveat. When we began talking through text on Wednesday night, she revealed that she had recently got out of an emotionally abusive relationship a few months ago and how much it had affected her. Also, FWIW, she had “Don’t know” on her Basic info section for where you say what  you are “Looking for” e.g. Casual, Relationship, etc. Does anyone think that she may still be getting over this past breakup and felt awkward continuing with me or do you think I should believe her reason for not wanting to talk anymore?

,Bumble,"So, I changed my summary to “Strongly not interested in white boys.” Cause they’re the ones that are mostly in my beeline.

Later that day, my match messaged me on the app and we start talking again. We talked again on Wednesday night through the app. The conversation was going really well and I eventually got her number. From that point, we started talking off the app through text. Last night, I figured I would pick up the conversation and sent her a text asking about a conference she had said she was doing.

I'm a freelance journalist, looking to talk to people who have been catfished during the lockdown.

The lockdown has driven an increasing number of people to dating apps; with fewer opportunities for face-to-face contact, the risks of people being catfished will also be increasing.

Of course, you could remain anonymous for this – please DM me if you're up for talking to me about this. 18+ only please.

,Bumble,"M58 - I ended a previous relationship at about the beginning of the year.  As luck would have it, I joined Bumble about the 19th March.  A week later, the Ohio stay-at-home order was given. 

Much to my surprise, I started chatting with someone right away.  We carried on for a number of days through the app. Then I offered my phone number, with Gentleman’s promise not to call her or send any pictures, if we went to regular texting. 

That worked and we had been texting for about 2 1/2 weeks before we finally talked on the phone.  I asked her out on a Socially Distanced drive-by date. 

We drove up next to each other, outside Raising Caine‘s Chicken, and sorta met in person, kinda.... Each still in our cars.  

I had her follow me through the drive-through, where of course I paid for her dinner, and told them at the windows that we were on a first virtual date!  Lol 

She then followed in her car, and we parked next to each other at a local park so we could just talk through our windows while we ate. 

After a few more phone calls, &amp; lots of texts over a few more days. we continued to get along great, so I asked her if she was comfortable Socially Un-distancing.... Maybe going and getting a cup of coffee (knowing she’s addicted to Tim Hortons by that point) and sitting in my car WITH me.  She said Yes! 

Since she works in the dental field, she had been off work and socially distanced a week and a half longer than the rest of us in the state.  I have been off work and other than my parents, not been around hardly anyone either. 

We have since shared two meals together, several long walks and watched a movie together. Things are going along fine.  

Just might get to the ultimate in Social Un-distancing sometime down the road…. Being a Gentleman however, I will NOT be posting about that.... 😉

So, to those of you trying to find romance through online dating, don’t give up!  All hope is not lost!

,Bumble,"Let me start by saying I’m in south Florida, so the majority of guys on apps are extremely conventionally attractive. 

It seems like bumble only matches me with guys who are way too hot to be into me— now don’t get me wrong I don’t have low self-esteem, I think I’m really good looking. I am however, realistic in that while I consider myself pretty, many guys are turned off by my weight. I tend to weigh more than the guys I date, usually by a lot, but I can get away with it because my weight is set “in the right places.” 

But a lot of the guys I end up matching with are fitness junkies, and I had no problem messaging these guys until one guy said “How come only fat girls swipe me?” While I got a good quip in before I unmatched him, I’d be lying if I said it didn’t alter how I felt about messaging attractive guys.

I know you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take, and I shouldn’t reject myself before giving them a chance to accept or reject me, but I want to get a really good foot in the door. What are your suggestions as to what I can say?

EDIT: For all you illiterate fatphobic imbeciles...I asked how to send a good first message to get a good first impression, not how to lose weight. Hotty McDreamy HotAbs responded to me and we’ve been having a good conversation for several days. I get it, you’ve been conditioned to think fat women are unattractive due to media bias for skinny women. What you fail to account for is that being fat does not make someone ugly. Body Bias applies to men too—Channing Tatum was severely hydrated for the filming of Magic Mike to make his body fat less apparent on film. And he shouldn’t have had to do that, but he did because of body ideal implications placed on men as well. I might not have had good luck dating recently, but I am literally in college where most people are not seeking a serious relationship. I was also once a hookup only person at one point. My bad luck in dating is due to going on dates where a connection was not made, it was not due to my body fat. Consider what makes you hate people based on their appearance which was handed to them by a generic lottery and further affected by things like economic conditions, mental health, and even things as simple as gym anxiety.

,Bumble,"I'm a woman.  I got on Bumble looking for a workout pal (which I included in my profile).  I gotta say, I feel for you men out there.

I started out treating the women I matched with as ""friends I didn't know yet.""  When I matched with someone, I *always* texted either a substantive opener or reply.  I would go to their profile, find something interesting to ask about and send a couple of sentences.  And, at least at first, I never ghosted.

But, holy hell, so many women don't even appear to be able to have conversations with *other women*.  I matched with a ridiculous number of ""interviewees"" (i.e., they would answer your question...and you'd get nothing else back).  I had quite a few other nice conversations start up and, boom, right in the middle, they disappeared for no obvious reason.

And, more than once, I made workout plans with someone only to have them flake, often without notice.  WTF?  (In case you're wondering, my friends assure me that my social skills are just fine, lol.)

Ngl, I got sick of it.  After a couple of months of this nonsense, I started ghosting interviewees.  I stopped putting in as much effort into anyone, even those who were engaging in some actual conversation.  And, eventually, I even ghosted people who were engaging in a conversation but were brash enough to bring up controversial topics with someone they'd never even met (and who broached the topics in a way that I knew we were going to disagree).  I wanna break a sweat with a buddy because we're getting in some good cardio, not because we're arguing about Trump, FFS.

Finally, I just quit opening the app at all.  Why bother?

I guess what I'm saying is: I tried, just like you all are trying.  Some of you will have some great experiences.  It would be nice if everyone did.  But, also, life's short. Know when to cut bait and try something else.

,Bumble,"So, I've been talking to a guy from Bumble for several weeks. He has asked me out several times, but due to the Covid19 situation, I had to decline, at least in the immediacy. But, I also let him know that I was very interested and looked forward to getting together once all of this has passed. 

In the mean time, we've discussed traveling together, there's been flirtation, gotten to know each other, but we've sort of hit a plateau, and really there isn't much more to do other than actually meet in person. 

So, now that the quarantine seems to be slowly trickling to an end, I mentioned to him that maybe we could start looking ahead and coming up with with a date....a date for our date. Well, that didn't go the way I'd hoped it would. 

He said that with us being friends for now, he wasn't planning for a date. But, he'd like to meet up with me, for sure. Well, this confused me, as he is the one who asked me out in the first place. So, I said this to him. He said that relationships typically begin from friendship anyway, so he didn't really see it as a bad thing, necessarily. Now, I fully expected that maybe he was/is talking to other people (as am I) BUT, if he did find someone he wants to commit his time and interest to, I would hope that he would tell me.

For me, I'm in it for a proper date. I'm 38 years old, I'm not a spring chicken. So, I'm not into the ""Let's meet and hang out"" thing. I want an actual date. Creativity. Thoughtfulness. A meal or even just a slice of cheesecake. So, I told him, in no certain terms that either I was worthy of a date or I'm not, but if I'm not, then we really don't have much else to discuss and not really anywhere to go from here.

So finally the last person came up before that liked person, but I couldn't backtrack anymore even though I did shake the phone, nothing happened. Is it because I used up 9ish backtracks?

,Bumble,"Hi, everyone! Has anyone here every been blocked through an error and then regained access to their account?

**TL;DR:** I got a lot of matches in a short period of time, and I think Bumble thought it was suspicious behavior, so now I can't access my account and probably lost all my matches.

I've been locked out since Thursday morning, and immediately submitted a help form on their website. I didn't hear anything back in 48 hours (the automated email reply said it can sometimes take longer), but I also messaged their support on Facebook and Twitter, and even emailed support directly. I also messaged u/Bumbleapp the other day.

I definitely didn't break any T&amp;Cs (no solicitation, explicit messages, etc.). If I had, I wouldn't even need to ask why my account is blocked.

My best guess as to what happened is through a design flaw in the app (if you can even call it a flaw—it's literally how the app works).

I was playing around with the filters, and made them really restrictive. Once I ran out of profiles, an option to expand filters appeared. Once I clicked that, I immediately had a huge backlog of likes that I assume had been hidden because of my original filters. Given that we're stuck inside, I decided to go through them as quickly possible to find potential matches, knowing that even if that number was high, only a small percentage would actually message. Seemed like a great way to make social connections while we're all social distancing.

Anyway, I ended up with around 180 in my match queue in a few hours. Few things to note: I live in a major city and travel a lot, and the amount of likes I had to even get that number had been building for months.

I have to assume that for a guy's profile, it probably looked weird to their system that I'd get so many matches in that time frame. But all I did was use the app as intended: adjusted filters, got likes, and matched. I have very little tech ability, so there was no hacking or outside manipulation. I also had no idea likes could be hidden like that or appear all at once.

So yeah, a few matches I had connected with elsewhere confirmed that my profile is missing, so I have zero hope of actually getting all my matches back, but I absolutely should get my account reinstated.

Has anyone experienced anything like this at all? If so, how did it get resolved?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; I got a lot of matches in a short period of time, and I think Bumble thought it was suspicious behavior, so now I can&amp;#39;t access my account and probably lost all my matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been locked out since Thursday morning, and immediately submitted a help form on their website.

,Bumble,"So I was online dating on and off for four years and got a pretty decent amount of matches on tinder and bumble during the times when I was on it. I'll be honest I'm a pretty mediocre looking person with interest that equals to your grandma's. So as time passed I figured out my own little algorithm on bios and pictures that upped my chances at finding someone. As I scrawled through people's pages I found that there were consistent left swipe motions because of what I didn't like about their page ie. only one photo, has no bio, their bio is a statement of ""don't date me cause I'm crazy'. After realizing this I edited my profile so many times to put the right set to myself. After finding my SO I gave a couple friends a hand on making their profiles a bit more tidy and some have come out successful. 

So here it is:

Three parts to a bio: 

Good introduction sentence that catches the eye (~2 sentences long) be artistic with this because using the basic lines of 'So my name is John...' 'Ugh I don't know really what to say swipe me and we can talk' doesn't work. We are setting you up as a promotional item, one of a kind, so that people will want to read more.

Personality/life statement(s)(~2sentences) this one is more so if you want a SO. Seeing if your aspirations are aligned, same lifestyle type, you have a kid, interesting things about yourself. If you want to just get laid you can skip this part.

Interests (very open) are super important to have! It's the good to have multiple so it's easy for other person to have choices on what to start talking about and a quick glimpse on if your interests matches.  When I wrote mine I just wrote it along the lines of 'biking, coffee, sewing, music' basically a giant run on sentence that listed everything out clean and flat. If you want pretty sentences only do a couple interests of what you really like.

*I will note that when I used bumble I found that those inserts just made your page wayyy too long, so I stuck with just writing everything in the bio itself.*


Make sure to keep it short enough a person will be willing to read it all but long enough to engage a person with options. Watch your word count because sometimes you won't realize how long it actually is and it's like reading a novel.


Pictures that are needed:

-Facial or at least a closer up photo

-One that has a full body shot (show yourself off)

-One where it's really relaxed like a friend taking a picture of you and you didn't know

-something funny you're doing


Pictures to avoid:

-Pictures with exes or something where it looks like your cutting out your ex of the photo.

-Ones where it honestly looks like you're dating another person in the photo even if they're your best friend or sibling. 

-Overly busy photos like group shots because I don't feel like playing where's Waldo.


Honestly your profiles are like advertisements for yourself, showing yourself off and become the business men who self promotes. Be proud of who you are! Sooner or later you'll find a person who aligns with you and having conversation with them is fantastic even of it doesn't result in a date. Keep swiping it's a fun way to pass time, find a SO, or even make a friend.

If you want an example I'll give you mine, don't straight up use it because you need to be yourself and lying in your bio won't get you anywhere in the long run. So:

""Let's be honest, I'm on here to find another coffee addict who's willing to jump across the city with me to test every coffee shop out there. Us espresso junkies need to stick together!

Mediocre at best, night owl, drives with no destination, Reddit life, childfree, cartoons, cuddling, day dreamer, pizza, cheap white wine, vanilla latte, striped tshirt, plaid flannels, every music genre, piercing and tattoo devotee""

,Bumble,"So guys, I know probably all of you have faced this situation on bumble tons of time. You match with this pretty girl and you so hope she texts first, but obviously she doesn't.

So this week I matched with two girls. Both of them were pretty cute. So I was expecting to atleast get a reply from one of them. None of them replied. Both of the matches expired. So one of their profile had these regular 'follow me on Instagram not much active here' line. I have seen this line in the profile of many girls. I don't understand what should I do about it!

So I wanted to ask you guys that should I text her on Instagram? Tbh I was kind of interested to know her because she had a witty bio. If yes, what should I text? I mean I don't know in what context should I start like should I tell her that we matched on bumble or just start with a pick up line? And also if no, why?

I mean I don&amp;#39;t know in what context should I start like should I tell her that we matched on bumble or just start with a pick up line? And also if no, why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks guys. Some helpful feedback would be really appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

,Bumble,"So i guess for a background, I'm a 25 year old male, 6', and an average build. I have always had poor results with bumble and not to sound self absorbed id say I'm a fairly decent looking guy, with quality photos and bio. haha All that totaling to around 4 matches and like 4-5 likes in the cue. All matches/likes being ones I'm not really interested in.

That said, i had an odd thing happen to me and I'm curious if anyone had experienced this as well. So one day i was on my lunch break and i opened up Bumble and it said i had a whopping 30-40 likes in the cue. Which was really surprising since i never get results like that. That morning (like 2hrs prior) I'm sure there was only a few likes in the cue.  I thought my account was glitching so i completely closed out of the app a few times and the same 30-40 likes were still there. So i did some swiping with no luck, not surprised. I maybe only swiped on 5-10 people and went back to work.I got on a few time just to see if they were still there, which they were. After work i opened up bumble again my cue was back down to 4-5 likes. Which was really strange. 

Has anyone experienced this and do you think Bumble is purposely not showing you everyone who has liked you? Like throttling your account and only showing low quality matches.

,Bumble,"Bumble doesn’t give much option for listing your preferences in a relationship. We can be negative about that later, right now I want to focus on the elephant in the room.

“Don’t Know Yet” makes absolutely no sense as a modifier on a dating app. There is no use case I can think of where I’d think it made sense. We all know why we are here. I would assume (and the app experience I have tends to confirm) most of us are looking for a relationship. Some people aren’t, and that’s okay too. But exactly no one on the app should have no idea what they are doing there. You didn’t stumble upon this, download on your phone, and make a profile for no reason. 

There are multiple *actual* reasons I could see people putting this down, and if any of these are you, just hit that updoot and know I won’t be matching with you. 

Here’s what I’ve got:

1. You know full well what you’re looking for, and it’s a hookup with an absolute dream guy/girl. First, they don’t exist, stop looking. Second, if they did exist, and wanted to hook up with you, why would they do so with you having a “don’t know lol” in your profile? Show some initiative, it’s sexy. There’s a “Something Casual” option for a reason! Set it on, and use the sorting system to find your wonderful Prince Charming! 

2. You don’t like the other options. Yes, the options on Bumble suck. You’re right. But if you don’t want a relationship, and don’t want marriage... you’re looking for something casual! So set yourself there. Picking “Don’t Know Yet” makes it look like you’re simply indecisive. 

3. You’re actually indecisive and could go either way on a “relationship” or “something casual.” The good news is, *Bumble has a sorting system!* You can factor out people who are looking for marriage and only look at people that are looking for a what you want! You don’t have to pretend you have no preferences at all, you can list either of the ones you’re torn between and match with people in the other category! 

4. You’re looking for friends. I have absolutely no patience with you. Get off the platform. Bumble has a dedicated, curated, non-sexual “Friends” choice when you create an account. You decided you wanted to get on the relationship setting. *You are actively leading people on* with your account. If I see you, I’ll report you.

,Bumble,"Has anyone here ever been kicked off Bumble?

**TL;DR:** I got a lot of matches in a short period of time, and I think Bumble thought I was using a bot, so now I can't access my account and possibly lost all my matches.

I've been using Bumble for nearly a year or so and actually shelled out for the lifetime subscription (I'm in a very stable open marriage, so frankly, it kind of made sense).

Anyway, I'm stuck inside like everyone else, so I decided to start playing around with the filters, and found that if you make them too restrictive, you can actually hit an expand filter button that appears when there are no more profiles available.

I hit that button, and, apparently, I had accrued a lot of likes over the year that I hadn't seen until now because they were filtered out. There were around 1,400—I live in a major city and travel a lot.

Well, now that I have some time being stuck inside, I decided to try to go through those as quickly as I could to find matches. I got through about 1,000 and ended up with around 180 in my match queue. Yeah, I know there's no way to reasonably maintain conversations with 180 matches, but because I list my open marriage in my profile and the fact that a lot of people just don't message, I knew I'd maybe only get 20 replies at most.

Anyway, that was Wednesday night. By Thursday morning, I'm carrying on a few conversations when my messages stop sending, and I get an error notification. I close the app, re-open it, and then find that I'm logged out. The problem is, it won't accept my password or send a code for a new one. If I enter a wrong password, it'll let me know. If I enter the correct one, nothing happens.

I messaged customer support 24 hours ago, so they still have another 24 to reply based on the automated email, but I'm kind of wondering if they think I was using a bot or something? I mean, for a guy, getting 180 matches within a few hours doesn't seem likely. But all I was doing was going through this crazy backlog of likes that I didn't know I had up until that point.

I messaged a girl on Instagram that I had matched with, and she confirmed that my profile no longer shows up.

So yeah, I'm waiting to hear back on whether I can get my account back up and running, or if I need to demand a refund. I didn't break any of the T&amp;Cs, and I definitely had some amazing matches I was excited to meet after all of this. Gotta say, it's kind of terrible timing to have a social line cut off when we've been social distancing for more than a month now with at least another to go.

I know it's kind of ridiculous, but has anyone else experienced anything like this at all? How have your experiences been with their customer support team?",t2_68blatnn,False,,0,False,Kicked off bumble?,[],r/Bumble,False,6,,0,False,t3_g342uw,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1587165866.0,text,6,,,text,self.Bumble,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has anyone here ever been kicked off Bumble?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; I got a lot of matches in a short period of time, and I think Bumble thought I was using a bot, so now I can&amp;#39;t access my account and possibly lost all my matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been using Bumble for nearly a year or so and actually shelled out for the lifetime subscription (I&amp;#39;m in a very stable open marriage, so frankly, it kind of made sense).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#39;m stuck inside like everyone else, so I decided to start playing around with the filters, and found that if you make them too restrictive, you can actually hit an expand filter button that appears when there are no more profiles available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hit that button, and, apparently, I had accrued a lot of likes over the year that I hadn&amp;#39;t seen until now because they were filtered out. There were around 1,400—I live in a major city and travel a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, now that I have some time being stuck inside, I decided to try to go through those as quickly as I could to find matches. I got through about 1,000 and ended up with around 180 in my match queue. Yeah, I know there&amp;#39;s no way to reasonably maintain conversations with 180 matches, but because I list my open marriage in my profile and the fact that a lot of people just don&amp;#39;t message, I knew I&amp;#39;d maybe only get 20 replies at most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that was Wednesday night. By Thursday morning, I&amp;#39;m carrying on a few conversations when my messages stop sending, and I get an error notification. I close the app, re-open it, and then find that I&amp;#39;m logged out. The problem is, it won&amp;#39;t accept my password or send a code for a new one. If I enter a wrong password, it&amp;#39;ll let me know. If I enter the correct one, nothing happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I messaged customer support 24 hours ago, so they still have another 24 to reply based on the automated email, but I&amp;#39;m kind of wondering if they think I was using a bot or something? I mean, for a guy, getting 180 matches within a few hours doesn&amp;#39;t seem likely. But all I was doing was going through this crazy backlog of likes that I didn&amp;#39;t know I had up until that point.&lt;/p&gt;

 I don't think anything works. It looks like everyone is out for an upgrade, there's nothing genuine or connectedness about the site.

 Some are looking for love, but are confused by the fake profiles. I felt there's alot of scammers on there with fake profiles. Not alot of conversations.
 
I guess, I'm choosing a very long break from dating, the dating world is allot more difficult to navigate. And being solo might be best for me.
Anyone else feel this way?

There's a lot of different personalities out there in which i would need to try to adapt too, they won't tell you about the different personalities, you'll need to figure it out and try to adapt.

It's there a thing called genuinely loved anymore? Does anyone stay married forever, for ever, ever?

Since cheating happens in most relationships, or we outgrow each other, why get married? Is Marriage just a myth now? Is it just a dream? 

There's a new version of a woman or man born everday,

 it looks like the older people want, someone younger, I guess they would be called Sugar daddy's?

 I don't know how many younger want older mates? I guess they would be cougars

,Bumble,"Maybe ladies go through this often. This week, I realized something as a result of the  interaction I had with a Bumble match. 

On paper, she was many things that always get my attention: attractive, spiritual, lived abroad in the past/spends extended time abroad every year, completed her PhD coursework already; loves learning and teaching.

The problem came in as we chatted back and forth. For some reason, her conversation left me...cold. 

It’s true she was polite and courteous. No problem there. For example, on more than one day, she was the first to reach out and wished me safety during the current pandemic or said she hoped my day was going well. 

I thought that was kind, but otherwise, everything that came from her was serious (as opposed to playful, fun, or funny) and factoid-ish. It was like reading an encyclopedia entry about her in black &amp; white instead of engaging with her one-on-one, in living color, in any sort of a stimulating way. 

It was really just hard to get anything going. No spark. Forget about banter or flirtation. 

Unfortunately she even said in one of her first responses to a question from me, that she “doesn’t have much time for fun” in her life. 

So after all this... the realization becomes, “WOW - how exactly would you end communication with someone early on, after you discover that trying to interact with them is just simply a bore?”

,Bumble,"Online dating experiences are completely different between men and women (and other genders too). And age differences can be vastly different as well. 

It can be hard and exhausting for all of us. Unlike the dumpster fire over at r/Tinder, this sub actually gives out advice, insight and experiences when it comes to Bumble and online dating in general. And considering there’s an active weekly profile thread, I’d say a lot of us want some form of success to a degree. I take advice and photo critique insights here on the regular.

Adding a gender and age flair would help tremendously in getting to know the perspective of everyone posting/commenting.  

The biggest one where this would help is the weekly profile critique. Example: I think a male, 34, is going to want to want to heavily take the profile critique of a user flaired F32 over a user flaired M22. He’s going to want to take the critique of a girl who’s around his age and would *potentially match with in real life* over the dude who’s 10 years his junior and is at a completely different stage of his life..... err, well, wait, no, hes actually gay and didnt mention it? And hes into younger dudes? Well shit, then hes probably going to want to take M22s photo critque more into consideration. 

I’ve also seen posts where someone asks a question and there’s usually a general agreed upon answer but the *better perspective* answer really depends on their gender and age. Example: a male, 19 going through a ghosting problem is probably going to want to take the advice of a user flaired M20 over the user flaired F27. Not that F27 would give out bad advice but F27’s ghosting problem advice she’s had from dudes in their mid 30s is probably **completely** different from the ghosting problems he’s experiencing from a dude with girls his age. 

See what I’m getting at?

There’s just a whole lot of scenarios in this sub where knowing gender and age would help tremendously. It’s small but very important, IMO.

,Bumble,"I thought I’d make a post about some general tips for guys, from my point of view as a woman. These are just my opinions, so take them with a grain of salt. If anybody has anything to add, please do so in the comments! Also, I’d love to hear basic tips from guys in regard to female profiles! 

1. Don’t get on Bumble just looking for a one night stand. I realize there’s a “something casual” option, but to me that means “I’m not really looking for a committed relationship but I’d love to find a friend and date and maybe throw some fun in there on a semi-regular basis”. If you’re looking for a one night stand, get on Tinder. 

2. Please have actual words in your profile. I don’t care how attractive you are, if your profile is just pictures, I swipe left. Your bio should be short, to the point, and maybe a little funny. Something that shows your personality. If you want quality matches, put a little effort in. If you want more than “Hey” as a first message, give us something to comment on! 

3. 1 or 2 selfies are ok, but please include pictures that were taken by someone else. Preferably showing your interests or lifestyle. That being said, don’t post a picture of your entire sports team or fraternity and make us try figure out which one is you. And for god’s sake, if you’re going to use a selfie, don’t take one while you’re laying on the couch with a scrunched up neck and the camera two inches from your face! 

4. Don’t put “ask me” as the answer to the question about your job or place of employment. If you don’t want to answer, just leave it blank. 

5. Once you’ve matched with someone, don’t immediately start talking about sex. I promise you, most of us are very interested in sex as well, but if you start talking about bedroom preferences before we’ve exchanged numbers or gone on a date, I’m going to unmatch. Good old fashioned sexting is super fun, but we generally want to know someone is actually interested in the PERSON before the sex. 

6. In that same vein, please do not answer every message with a simple yes or no, or other dead-end answer. If I’m making the effort to keep the conversation going, so should you. Personally, I have a three strike rule. If someone messages me back three times in a row without asking something or making an effort in the conversation, I unmatch. 

Again, if you’re a guy and you’ve read this far, please comment with general tips for us ladies!

1) Use pictures with dogs

2) Use pictures with cats

3) Use pictures with small children

4) If you want a one-night stand use the ""Something Casual"" option

5) Your bio should be whatever it needs to be to convey a sense of who you are as a person. Hobbies, political views, and life experiences are all a part of that. (If anyone says your bio is too long, it means they're too lazy/illiterate to read it so they're not worth your time anyways)

Afterwards, he texted me to apologize for the mix up and explained he didn’t know it was listed wrong.

I wanted to reach out and let you know I checked into my account settings and it does have me listed as 31. I’m not sure why that age is displayed, and now that I know I can’t figure out how to change it.

,Bumble,"Hey all.

I posted a similar question before and didn't get much traction but I really think you guys might have some good insight. 

Like so many readers of this sub, I am constantly endeavoring to improve my profile and thusly increases my rate of matches. Regulars might even recognize my username from the profile critique threads. 

I feel as though it is very difficult to create a profile which garners attention and sells myself effectively.  One of the key issues being that there are no examples of what I should be moving towards.  The most I often see are vague ideas.

If any of you have seen or are thr creators of strong profiles I think it would benefit myself and the other members of this sub to see you share them for inspiration purposes.

&lt;p&gt;I posted a similar question before and didn&amp;#39;t get much traction but I really think you guys might have some good insight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like so many readers of this sub, I am constantly endeavoring to improve my profile and thusly increases my rate of matches. Regulars might even recognize my username from the profile critique threads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel as though it is very difficult to create a profile which garners attention and sells myself effectively.  One of the key issues being that there are no examples of what I should be moving towards.  The most I often see are vague ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of you have seen or are thr creators of strong profiles I think it would benefit myself and the other members of this sub to see you share them for inspiration purposes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

,Bumble,"I am a 22 year old female and in a big city, I downloaded bumble. As usual for any girl, within 10 minutes it said there were 50+ guys in my beeline.

Well, known fact. Girls get easily tons of likes. Many guys say to struggle to get a few likes.

I changed my settings to looking for women. The beeline count went back on zero. I was already happy with 11 likes in less than an hour, wow there are women who like women here!! In 24 hours, I hit the 42 likes and the next day I hit 50+. Being pleasantly surprised I went on and been having some great fun conversations and scored a few numbers, likes been gaining.

I wondered why guys seemed to complain about girls not matching and messaging back. I am kind of a below average girl, not many fun pictures but did wrote things on my profile. So why is it so hard for men?

Made my handsome awesome guy friend join bumble; in real life he scores girls easily in bars.
No beeline for some hours, after 4 hours it said 2 likes. The next day it said 6.

I feel like there are way too many guys looking for girls on the app, that most guy profiles just literally disappear into no ones land and they have to be lucky to catch some interactin AND THEN get their profile gainbpopularity and shown to more women. 

Supply vs demand I guess? And there are (I think) less girls looking for girls so your profile obviously gets shown more, maybe? But in the other side, there are more girls who date guys then girls who date girls...

This makes me feel like the rating girl-guy is 1:150 or even more?!

I matched with someone recently who I’ve really enjoyed talking to for the past week and a half. He suggested a phone call or Facetime date which I was excited for, but wanted to sus him out a bit before pursuing this. He has his Instagram @ on his profile, but when I went to check it today, I realized it’s just the page for his hobby. When I went to that page’s tagged photos, I realized he did have his own Instagram page. Hmm. I wondered why he didn’t choose to put that one on his profile. Then, when I went to his own personal page, I saw photos of him and his daughter.

He never disclosed to me he had a kid. It is nowhere on his profile, and he chose not to answer that “want/dont want/have/etc” prompt. I find this to be really odd. I feel like everyone should be upfront about the fact that they have a kid - I don’t know, I know it’s personal - but it sort of feels like catfishing to me?

My profile pictures are decent, nothing off-putting in the bio/prompts (I’ve had friends of both sexes vet it before) and I’m trying to open without just a “hey.” However, I’m getting no responses. Out of about twenty matches so far, one has responded. Is this typical? Are people just swiping on everyone or swiping just to swipe during quarantine?&lt;/p&gt;

,Bumble,"Hi all!

I'm looking for some outside insight here...

On Monday, I [29F] matched with this guy [28M] and we hit it off from the first message. Not only did I find him really attractive (very handsome), but he was great to talk with and I loved learning about him!

We talked most of the day on Monday and all day on Tuesday. Later on Tuesday evening, we exchanged numbers to text instead of going through the app since we agreed to meet up once our lockdown is over in a week or two. Last night we sent a couple of texts, which followed him asking me a question before bed. I answered it before I went to sleep, but I never heard back from him... 

It's been over 24 hours since I last heard from him, but I'm not sure if I'm being ghosted or he has just been busy today. I'm not trying to overthink it, but I'm not sure if I should send him another message, just wait, or move on... Thoughts?

When I got bumble, I matched with about 10 or so people. I’ve been talking to all of them, but right now there’s one person I’m particularly interested above the others.
Now, I have very limited knowledge when it comes to dating unfortunately. I’m not sure if what I’m doing is right- how do I end the conversation with the 9 other people? Should I even end the conversation? I’ve only had this app for 2 days, so would it be acceptable to ghost someone who’s conversation has gone dry? Any and all advice is appreciated!!&lt;/p&gt;

,Bumble,"So I have no experience with online dating sites. I’m satisfied with the profile I have created and don’t need advice on starting conversations but I’m just totally confused how I’m supposed to even match or talk to anybody. 

The apps(hinge too)make it seem like the only way I’m ever going to chat with anybody is if I pay. Do any of you pay for this? It’s like 20 bucks a month! Why the hell is this so expensive???

I have high hopes for these apps but I want to avoid spending 15-30 bucks a month on dating apps. I will if I have to but I don’t have a job right now I’m just desperate enough to have social interaction that I would pay at this point..

When I’m on bumble it shows me that I have a few hearts in the top left and that if I want to connect with these people I need to “boost” my account and pay at least like 12 bucks I think before it even lets me talk to anybody? Is this correct? Not sure if I’m understanding how this works because if they offer a free service but I’m not even allowed to chat without paying...why do they even let me have a free profile?

Sure, it shows interest to some degree, but, it also seems strange that they’re wanting to go out again before meeting you to begin with. I also notice that the previous guys ended up being flaky and we never got to a point of doing those things together. It leads me to suspect that it’s not genuine🤔&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it a move or a line? Do any of you do it? If so, what’s your reasoning behind it?&lt;/p&gt;

,Bumble,"I fully acknowledge that this is likely going to be removed before too many read it but here goes. 

First and foremost, I will not out anyone - don't ask, she clearly has enough going on in her life that she doesn't need anyone else. 

Secondly, this mod isn't a mod here. If she is a mod here, well, this will be super short lived. 

**tl;dr** Met a woman through OLD, turns out she's a mod for few different subs, she has *at least* fifteen alts that she uses to argue with herself, and she (as a mod) thinks she's some relationship guru. 

So this all started back in January in a pretty depressing time of my life - holiday funk, death in the family, recent breakup, moved to a new town, ... Shitsville. So to meet some new people in my new city I installed them all. I wasn't picky or really looking for anything in particular so I just swiped on pretty much anyone that didn't seem crazy. One of my first matches WITH REPLY came from a woman about my age (30's) who wasn't my usual type. I probably wasn't hers but we clicked. We really did. She was fun and entertaining and we continued to chat for almost the past four months straight. 

Then she started to slip about a month ago. Instead of simple disagreements, things became really disproportionate in their reactions. For example, I asked her what she thought about sexting. I didn't ask if she wanted to but just what she thought. It was so innocent in context that I could have sent the whole discussion to my mother without blushing. The reply had to take her an hour to finger out. It was a full out rant.  

So I avoided anything on the topic of sex for the next few days, maybe a week, and did so until she brought it up again. After all, she wasn't really my type physically but at this point, who knew what could happen. Worst case I found a friend in life, best case I found my best friend. Anyways, I quickly discovered that I had opened Pandora's box after that. I would get random texts about relationship stuff at all hours of the day. Some sex, some not, all really off. Not really asking me but telling me her thoughts on these random scenarios. Something definitely triggered her. It was as if there was a random relationships topic generator and I was on the receiving end. 

Being a single guy on Reddit, I too read relationship subs from time-to-time but I have never told anyone. I didn't even tell her that I knew what Reddit was. Especially not these relationship or dating subs. Also, the relationship subs really aren't my cup of tea, they are entertaining here and there but really only when I'm out of everything else. So there I am one day reading some innocent post on a pretty popular relationship sub scrolling through the comments and one catches my eye. It's almost verbatim what she had told me only a few moments prior. So I click on the profile and it's full of the same stuff she'll randomly send me. I get only about 5% of what she's been posting and commenting but that 5% is verbatim. Odd. 

So I dig a little further and go down some of the history of this user and discover that she's been replying to others who were using my quotes???? What is going on??  Stuff like Reddit user A quotes me, and she, with this alt, is now replying to user A who is clearly her... And there are tons of them! I read the sub and go through some of the smaller ones and there I am all over the place. My stories that I shared with her are there, and in those comments she's replying to them with different alts just as she had to me. She's holding full-blown conversations with herself through the use of at least fifteen alts!  

But here's the crazy part, as if having alts to talk to and argue with isn't crazy enough, it's that she really believes that she's some relationship guru. She's the main mod (active wise) in quite a few of them and even her alts are mods.  Preaching about her experiences, her ""degrees"", and even posting just to be the white knight. 

(I know they are all hers and she's not 'talking to anyone about them then her friends post' because of the timing of them all and the way they are phrased. Too many coincidences to ignore.  

I obviously dropped her at this point because I felt more like my comments are just being used for her Reddit personalities but before I did, I tried to understand where she's coming from and why on earth anyone would do this. I've come to the conclusion that she's just fucking nuts. Like certifiable fucking nuts and there's nothing that, even me, the guy who is ""million times out of her league"" (not bragging, just for perspective), couldn't stop her from being. Even when I asked her about it, (she still deserved a proper good bye instead of ghosting) she just blew it all off for a day or two. I was about to delete it all and forget it when I got a long multi-part text from her. It had it all from ptsd to victimizing to ""all guys are trash"". The next day, she was right back at it with at least six of her alts. Literally hours of her day every day.  

I guess what I find more alarming is that her comments and even ""powers"" as a mod influence so many here.

,Bumble,"Alright, this is a long and complicated story but I promise it’s worth the read. It’s juicy, it’s shameless, and it’s filled with a lot of “I swear I can’t make this shit up moments”. This is the story of 3 times I met a girl off BumbleBFF, only to ultimately have the friendship come crashing down all within a 6 month time frame cuz I can’t seem to have low drama, healthy, platonic friendships. 

So I thought I’d try bumble BFF after hosting a party that turned into being a sausage fest cuz I realized most my friends are dudes (I’m a female). 

Friend #1: invited her over for a wine night at mine and of course the dumb bitch brings her boyfriend cuz she can’t do anything by herself. 
She was quite abrasive and annoying and didn’t contribute much to the convo but I totally hit it off with her boyfriend. Flash forward 3 months after the three of us forming a tight knit friend group that combined our other friend groups and they break up and I start secretly seeing the boyfriend after we confessed feelings. She finds out and to this day (5 months later) still harasses me on Instagram. He has a new gf and I’ve moved on, but she’s still salty about it. Whatever, best dick I got in a while tbh. 

Friend #2: invited her to a party after matching and of course, dumb bitch has to bring her boyfriend. She’s pretty cool but I’m getting unexplainable crazy bitch vibes. One day she starts to talk about how she is in an open relationship with her boyfriend. I’m getting excited cuz I’m thinking she’s flirting with me but then (insert record scratch) she asks me if I would be interested in fucking her boyfriend who she lived with. A part of me was intrigued but most of me had the feeling that he had underwhelming dicking down game. Immediately I think it’s a trap because she knew what had happened with the last girl and was trying to get me to say I’d fuck her boyfriend. So I said I wasn’t into him. A couple weeks go by and she hits me up again with another request; to have a threesome with this 34 year old guy who was fucking on the side. I was about to move to Florida and riding the high of quitting my job and saying fuck it and agreed to do it. So her and I (both 20) tag team this sexy divorcee engineer guy and it was super hot. 

Shit you not, I happened to run into him again in Florida just a few weeks after that happened while I was on my way from Tampa to Miami. She found out I saw him and got territorial over A SIDE HOE that we both fucked and blocked me on everything. Oh well, she was fucking crazy but I do miss our sexcapades. 

Lastly, I give you 

Friend #3: I met her while I was solo traveling through Tampa. She was 21, he was 27. They lived in a leasing office that was converted into a tiny apartment that was attached to their building her dad owned. She was a raging liberal (which i loved) with super strange contrasting views. Everything about her personality was magnetic. And they were both raging alcoholics. Like everybody in Florida is an alcoholic but they were like next level. Shortly after matching, she invited me over to drink white claws with her and her husband. 
I get there and we are instantly vibing and exchanging crazy stories. About an hour into hanging out her boyfriend grabs my face and starts making out with me. I go along with it cuz once again I was in a fuck it mentality. I ended up spending a week living with them until the girl decides she is a lesbian and in love with me and wants to get a divorce. Her husband was being such an emotional bitch boy and wouldn’t let us go out to a club alone. So we agree to all go to the club together with the secret intent of ditching him in the club and running away for a couple days. In order to buy time, I convinced this super weird Czech guy who looks like he didn’t have eyebrows to meet us in the club to distract the husband while we ditched them. I decided he was the perfect candidate after he went on for about an hour about how he has a saltine fetish. Yes, you heard that right, a fucking saltine fetish!!! We get into the club “The Castle” in Ybor City, which was basically filled with creepy predators in speedos, little bitch boy subs/simps, and the type of girls who identified as wolves in middle school and hissed at people when you tried to talk to them. Plus size chicks in leather galore. I’m not shaming, just painting the picture. 

Anyways, we tell them we’re going to the bathroom to fuck each other and bolt out of the club. We ended up going to the dudes place that they use to have group sex with who happened to be up at 4 am for work (he was in the military). We ask if we can sleep at his place to get away from the over emotional mess that was her husband and he let us just crash at his place while he was at work. His weird roommate/husband (he was straight but married him for military housing benefits) was there and I saw him come out of his room once with a python wrapped around his wrist. I honestly can’t make this shit up. 
Nonchalantly he gives us the password to the WiFi and tells us he will back at 1 and is down to go get dinner later. We finally get to sleep after pulling a 3 day bender. 

After spending another week with this chick trying to get her to sober up, she ends up getting back with her husband and kicks me out of her lil studio apartment. I was more or less living out of my station wagon after quitting my job and trying to start a new life in Florida. 
Ultimately, as much fun as she was to hang with and play with, she was fucking psycho and Tampa was gross so I hit the road to the Key West. Her husband still hits me up black out drunk occasionally saying how he wants to hate fuck me. I really should block him but it’s quality entertainment, he’s such a pathetic simp. 

All in all, I don’t talk to either 3 girls, but ironically, I am still friends with friend #1s ex boyfriends ex girlfriend and on decent terms with the ex boyfriend who I started seeing behind her back. As for friend #2, I occasionally talk to the side hoe who we tag teamed. And as for friend #3, I talk to the guy who let us crash at his place almost every day, and occasionally Snapchat some of the random girls we (friend #3) met from inviting random people to come drink on the beach with us. We actually started a group chat called the coochie cult where we could just whore out in. Unfortunately when she got back with her simp, the group dissolved, kinda miss those hoes tbh. Sometimes I think about saltine guy, and his weird collection of religious memorabilia. That guy was so fucking weird. 

So there you have it folks, you can make friends on bumble bff, just try not to fuck them, their boyfriend, their side hoe, their husband or their friends.",t2_6f7i7r0h,False,,0,False,"Dear future bumbleBFF match: for the sake of your relationship pls leave your boyfriend at home.

It’s juicy, it’s shameless, and it’s filled with a lot of “I swear I can’t make this shit up moments”. This is the story of 3 times I met a girl off BumbleBFF, only to ultimately have the friendship come crashing down all within a 6 month time frame cuz I can’t seem to have low drama, healthy, platonic friendships. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I thought I’d try bumble BFF after hosting a party that turned into being a sausage fest cuz I realized most my friends are dudes (I’m a female). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friend #1: invited her over for a wine night at mine and of course the dumb bitch brings her boyfriend cuz she can’t do anything by herself. 
She was quite abrasive and annoying and didn’t contribute much to the convo but I totally hit it off with her boyfriend. Flash forward 3 months after the three of us forming a tight knit friend group that combined our other friend groups and they break up and I start secretly seeing the boyfriend after we confessed feelings. She finds out and to this day (5 months later) still harasses me on Instagram. He has a new gf and I’ve moved on, but she’s still salty about it. Whatever, best dick I got in a while tbh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friend #2: invited her to a party after matching and of course, dumb bitch has to bring her boyfriend. She’s pretty cool but I’m getting unexplainable crazy bitch vibes. One day she starts to talk about how she is in an open relationship with her boyfriend. I’m getting excited cuz I’m thinking she’s flirting with me but then (insert record scratch) she asks me if I would be interested in fucking her boyfriend who she lived with. A part of me was intrigued but most of me had the feeling that he had underwhelming dicking down game. Immediately I think it’s a trap because she knew what had happened with the last girl and was trying to get me to say I’d fuck her boyfriend. So I said I wasn’t into him. A couple weeks go by and she hits me up again with another request; to have a threesome with this 34 year old guy who was fucking on the side. I was about to move to Florida and riding the high of quitting my job and saying fuck it and agreed to do it. So her and I (both 20) tag team this sexy divorcee engineer guy and it was super hot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shit you not, I happened to run into him again in Florida just a few weeks after that happened while I was on my way from Tampa to Miami. She found out I saw him and got territorial over A SIDE HOE that we both fucked and blocked me on everything. Oh well, she was fucking crazy but I do miss our sexcapades. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I give you &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friend #3: I met her while I was solo traveling through Tampa. She was 21, he was 27. They lived in a leasing office that was converted into a tiny apartment that was attached to their building her dad owned. She was a raging liberal (which i loved) with super strange contrasting views. Everything about her personality was magnetic. And they were both raging alcoholics. Like everybody in Florida is an alcoholic but they were like next level. Shortly after matching, she invited me over to drink white claws with her and her husband. 
I get there and we are instantly vibing and exchanging crazy stories. About an hour into hanging out her boyfriend grabs my face and starts making out with me. I go along with it cuz once again I was in a fuck it mentality. I ended up spending a week living with them until the girl decides she is a lesbian and in love with me and wants to get a divorce. Her husband was being such an emotional bitch boy and wouldn’t let us go out to a club alone. So we agree to all go to the club together with the secret intent of ditching him in the club and running away for a couple days. In order to buy time, I convinced this super weird Czech guy who looks like he didn’t have eyebrows to meet us in the club to distract the husband while we ditched them. I decided he was the perfect candidate after he went on for about an hour about how he has a saltine fetish. Yes, you heard that right, a fucking saltine fetish!!! We get into the club “The Castle” in Ybor City, which was basically filled with creepy predators in speedos, little bitch boy subs/simps, and the type of girls who identified as wolves in middle school and hissed at people when you tried to talk to them. Plus size chicks in leather galore. I’m not shaming, just painting the picture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, we tell them we’re going to the bathroom to fuck each other and bolt out of the club. We ended up going to the dudes place that they use to have group sex with who happened to be up at 4 am for work (he was in the military). We ask if we can sleep at his place to get away from the over emotional mess that was her husband and he let us just crash at his place while he was at work. His weird roommate/husband (he was straight but married him for military housing benefits) was there and I saw him come out of his room once with a python wrapped around his wrist. I honestly can’t make this shit up. 
Nonchalantly he gives us the password to the WiFi and tells us he will back at 1 and is down to go get dinner later. We finally get to sleep after pulling a 3 day bender. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending another week with this chick trying to get her to sober up, she ends up getting back with her husband and kicks me out of her lil studio apartment. I was more or less living out of my station wagon after quitting my job and trying to start a new life in Florida. 
Ultimately, as much fun as she was to hang with and play with, she was fucking psycho and Tampa was gross so I hit the road to the Key West. Her husband still hits me up black out drunk occasionally saying how he wants to hate fuck me. I really should block him but it’s quality entertainment, he’s such a pathetic simp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I don’t talk to either 3 girls, but ironically, I am still friends with friend #1s ex boyfriends ex girlfriend and on decent terms with the ex boyfriend who I started seeing behind her back. As for friend #2, I occasionally talk to the side hoe who we tag teamed. And as for friend #3, I talk to the guy who let us crash at his place almost every day, and occasionally Snapchat some of the random girls we (friend #3) met from inviting random people to come drink on the beach with us. We actually started a group chat called the coochie cult where we could just whore out in. Unfortunately when she got back with her simp, the group dissolved, kinda miss those hoes tbh. Sometimes I think about saltine guy, and his weird collection of religious memorabilia. That guy was so fucking weird. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it folks, you can make friends on bumble bff, just try not to fuck them, their boyfriend, their side hoe, their husband or their friends.&lt;/p&gt;

,Bumble,"So I downloaded the Bumble app for the friends feature, but when I read about the women message first feature I tried the date section aswell.

But man oh man is it useless; I literally have been using it for less then a day and got 3 matches, of which all of them just send “Hey”. Like, what do they expect from me? Do they want me to start a conversation going of just the bland ass profiles with only selfies? And it’s not the case that I have nothing on my profile; I have interests, pictures of festivals I attended etc.

And no, I don’t mind starting conversation, I have done so on Tinder. But come on, what’s up with these double standards. A “Hey” normally isn’t enough, but when women start the conversation it is?

Just to clarify a few things, this Thread isn’t about women having to be interesting on “swiping apps”. The “problem” I have with the feature that lets women message first is that it’s kind of pointless if women just send “Hey”. You have already swiped right on someone because you are interested, so just by saying hello in essence you swipe right twice.

,Bumble,"Ah, ghosting - what a fun quarantine activity.

Intellectually, I know ghosting comes with the territory. But it doesn’t make it suck any less. 

Short version, I’m a gal in my 30s, and he’s also in his 30s, both verified. Spent a couple nights messaging back and forth on the app. Tons in common. Equal reciprocation of depth in the conversation, him asking a lot of questions about me. After a few days of awesome conversation, I cop that it might be a bit direct and asked for his number. I say if he’s not down for that, totally fine! No response required.

He replies with enthusiasm. Says he will definitely text me later on that night and he does! Also says he likes me being direct so “keep it up :)”

So then we text for a few nights. Again pretty late, lots of depth, a ton in common, feels super positive. He’s asking lots of questions about me and I do the same. We both say when things are over we should definitely grab drinks. 

Finally I decide to offer up the idea of a virtual happy hour after about a week of that. 

I text that I have a question for him. I see him start to reply - he was always prompt in replying or texting - but my follow up asking for a virtual hang got sent first - I didn’t want to chicken out.

And then... nothing. Not a word, no reply.

Finally three days later I say that whoops I guess that was too direct and If it was, I’m sorry. I thank him for the really great conversations. 

I end the super short message saying that he should feel no pressure to respond truly and that I hoped he was having a good week.

And still nothing. 

But he also hasn’t unmatched me.

Based on the level of fun we were having mutually, the escalation, and the fact that he was fine exchanging numbers and saying yes to meeting up... although who knows maybe I’m wrong. It just seemed like a strange spot to ghost. 

I wish I could ask but that would be pointless and weird I’m sure since I already basically sent the “bye” text.

&lt;p&gt;So then we text for a few nights. Again pretty late, lots of depth, a ton in common, feels super positive. He’s asking lots of questions about me and I do the same. We both say when things are over we should definitely grab drinks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I decide to offer up the idea of a virtual happy hour after about a week of that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I text that I have a question for him. I see him start to reply - he was always prompt in replying or texting - but my follow up asking for a virtual hang got sent first - I didn’t want to chicken out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then... nothing. Not a word, no reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally three days later I say that whoops I guess that was too direct and If it was, I’m sorry. I thank him for the really great conversations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I end the super short message saying that he should feel no pressure to respond truly and that I hoped he was having a good week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And still nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he also hasn’t unmatched me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the level of fun we were having mutually, the escalation, and the fact that he was fine exchanging numbers and saying yes to meeting up... although who knows maybe I’m wrong. It just seemed like a strange spot to ghost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could ask but that would be pointless and weird I’m sure since I already basically sent the “bye” text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, I’ve given plenty of advice to girlfriends who have been ghosted, but this set of circumstances just seems off. I wish I got it. And now I’m just bummed out. Bleh. What a bummer.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

* Wash your face with [facial cleanser](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/gf94a1/giving_advice_hygiene_suggestions_to_better/fpuwwsb?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) (which is hydrating), not body soap (which is drying), and pat dry.  Men need to care for their faces as much as women do!  (*ETA link to 4 suggested cleansers*)
* Use a toner on oily areas and/or open pores (especially the nose). *ETA witchhazel can be applied with a cottonball a couple times a week as a toner after facial cleansing*.
* Use a moisturizer, preferably with SPF if going outside.  Cancer isn't specific to any gender.
* Use lip balm to condition and protect your lips.  [Burt's Bees](https://www.burtsbees.com/lip-care/lip-balm/) is great, the one in [the tin](https://www.burtsbees.com/product/beeswax-lip-balm-tin/10999-00.html) is my fav.  Avoid petroleum based products.
* Shave in the same direction as the growth of the hair, and soften your facial hair before shaving it to prevent ingrowths and nicks.
* If you have a beard, take care of it because well-groomed beards are sexy!   [This webpage](https://www.mensxp.com/grooming/beards-and-shaving.html) has links to various helps for patchy beards, full beards, etc.
* Cut and file your nails regularly.  Keep lotion by the sink to moisturize after hand washing.
* SHOWER!  Before bed gets rid of outside allergens; quick one when you wake so you're fresh for your day and can easily style your hair/beard; after the gym/workout; before an event (party, date, etc).
* Clean your ears!
* Check for stray hairs: ears, nose, eyebrows.
* Keep your head hair clean and trimmed; no greasy or straggly hair.
* Wear well-fitting clothes.  If you're a large, don't drown yourself in a 3x t-shirt; likewise don't try to cram into a medium if you're a large.  When going on a date, leave the clothing with writing on it at home.
* Wear **clean**, good condition shoes; polish dress shoes to remove scuffs.  You can [clean sneaker soles](https://youtu.be/hzePuTLDeaM?t=45) with toothpaste or baking soda.  If you clean them when you get home before putting away they're ready if you need to leave at a a moment's notice.    
Use [foot powder](https://www.goldbond.com/blog/product/maximum-strength-medicated-foot-powder/) on your feet to keep your shoes and feet from smelling bad.
* Smelly feet? That usually means bacteria or infection.  Soak them for about an hour in epsom salts to soothe and soften, add about a cup of cheap antiseptic mouthwash or white vinegar to every quart of water to kill the bacteria; scrub your feet to remove dead skin and **dry feet thoroughly**.    
If you have yellow toenails or especially smelly feet: after your foot soak, before bed use Vick's vapor rub on your toenails and toes then cover with cotton socks; this will help prevent nail fungus.
* Wear anti-perspirant or deodorant (these do different things! Select the right one for you).  If you also want to wear cologne, get the matching deodorant scent; don't mix and match different scents.  Wear an undershirt if you tend to sweat a lot.    
**Never ever** try to disguise body odor with cologne.
* Brush and floss teeth, especially before bed!  Use an [anticavity mouthwash](https://www.actoralcare.com/products/act-restoring/) and don't eat or drink (except water) after preparing for bed.  [Plackers](https://www.plackers.com) make flossing easy!  Tooth care is extremely important and is the most important to me.

We all have things going on in our lives that prevent us from reaching out and the longer it persists, the harder it is to get back in touch.

1) When you start off on Tinder and you start to get some likes why does Tinder have a habit of showing you to people outside of your preference when there’s girls like less than 2km?? No one wants to see 100 likes all from people over 50km away 🤬.

2) Both apps like to blur photos but also expect you to pay for the service, surely it seems more fair showing you their pictures and distance but not their names so you know what you’re paying for... don’t you think it’s a bit scammy wanting your money and not telling you exactly what you’re getting for it?

3) Do you believe that bumble and tinder show you people who have already swiped left on you? Defeats the purpose of showing you anyone you have 0% chance of matching with.

4) Has anyone else who’s in shape, got a good figure, workout abs whatever noticed that you seem to get more likes from bigger girls who you just aren’t interested in? It’s like bumble and tinder seem to believe in shape guys only like fat chicks? 

5) Do you believe that tinder should be more transparent in their modelling of the app for example giving you a list of girls who have left swiped you so you can compare your own match rate.

6) I believe that Tinder should add a feature that somehow stops you being shown to people you know for example friends and exes.
