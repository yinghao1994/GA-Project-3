,coffeemeetsbagel,"TL;DR: Should I initiate our convo after we both kinda flaked on our first date and not texted for a week now?

I am 23, he is 27. We met on CMB and texted for over a month. He asked me out **LAST MINUTE(!)** for like **10+** times but I was either too busy, too lazy or feeling ugly so I rejected them all. (I really prefer dates planned at least a day ahead rather than impromptu ones) He asked me to propose a date so I picked Saturday and he agreed. (P.S. I just got a soul-sucking job that required working 6 days/week so I took a Saturday leave for our ""first date"". He didn't know about my pathetic work schedule though. He only knew I got a new job.)

No text during the day on Friday so I assumed the date was off :'(

On **Friday 11pm**, he texted me asking me where I wanna go tmr, and I replied ""You decide :p"" and asked him when he was available. He said he was available **in the afternoon**. A few mins later, he asked me if I would like to go for **lunch** or **dinner**. (So I assumed he was available **BOTH** in the **afternoon** and at **night** right??)

I only have a sad lil weekly day-off so I planned to squeeze my social (distancing) activities in one day - meet my friend **in the afternoon** and meet him **in the evening**. I replied to him **THE NEXT DAY 10am**(*did I reply too late?*) that I am available at 6pm. An hour later he said he couldn't make it if it's tonight... so I replied ""Oh okay then...""

TBH I was pretty pissed because I took my leave **FOR HIM**. I thought he was available **BOTH** in the **afternoon** and at **night.** Did he suddenly have a date with an unknown girl?! :(

Later that night he asked me what I did today and I replied hanging out with friend and trying out a restaurant. I asked him back and he said he went to an island nearby with his high school friend. He sent me a photo of him putting his hands in his pockets (*okay he's pretty muscular*) at the beach with blue sky, the kind of photo that's pretty *Insta*. He asked me if the food was nice.

And here we go, I replied ""Really nice weather lol"" and ""Very yummy :p"" *(Did I make a mistake not complimenting him? I actually did. I whispered* ***so muscular*** *when I saw it... Though now thinking about it, I would also feel sad if I sent a guy my photo and he only commented on the background.)*

He only replied to my ""Very yummy"" message with a thumbs-up cute pug sticker **the next morning**, and THAT'S IT.

THAT'S IT.

He used to text me good morning and goodnight, asked me about my day EVERYDAY. He would double text me if I haven't replied for long. I expected he would text me later but no... NOTHING. So I really put up my A-game, 2 days later I replied to the sticker with ""So cute"". And...

He did not reply.

Now one week has passed, should I text him? It would really bruise my ego (even more) if he doesn't reply/reply unenthusiastically.

P.S. I am a relationship virgin as if you couldn't tell already.. I really thought we had a chance and I could finally get into a relationship like EVER.

UPDATE: I know not meeting up is the best during this time, but in my country the number of local cases is 0 for quite a number of days, and we both still have to go to work at office everyday so I think it is acceptable if we BOTH wear masks when we meet.

UPDATE 2: I messaged him and he responded. But he sounds less warm than he used to... maybe he has met other girl(s) in these roughly 10 days.

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: I know not meeting up is the best during this time, but in my country the number of local cases is 0 for quite a number of days, and we both still have to go to work at office everyday so I think it is acceptable if we BOTH wear masks when we meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE 2: I messaged him and he responded. But he sounds less warm than he used to... maybe he has met other girl(s) in these roughly 10 days. No date is mentioned yet... because I&amp;#39;m not even sure if he is interested to see me now. &lt;/p&gt;

Let's say you are virtual dating right now and have narrowed it down to one person that you're talking to consistently.

End Nov, someone liked me and started the chat by exchanging nationality. He claims to be a Singaporean Chinese working in the UK and coming back next month. What's odd is that... he doesn't understand singlish (despite saying that he has a family in Singapore). The chat window was ending so he added me on Line. He also claimed that he has a house in marina sands, but he doesn't know the answer to ""Which MRT is that?"" By then, I am sure that this guy is super fake. He also nags for my whatsapp number. Additionally, his English is poorly written (how can someone who's working in the UK be that bad?)

Mid Jan, 46 years old claiming to be an Indonesian American and working in Singapore. When I told him that I'd prefer to meet in person, he said that he's traveling to US that night. Also asked for Whatsapp number. I concluded, this guy is another fake.

March, another person claiming to be a Singaporean who grow up in Australia but working in Hapag-Lloyd, Cambodia. No more lousy chit chat, I ask for a proof for a real being. No answer. CMB then adding a text saying that this user is flagged for possibly violating terms.

March, another person said interested but again, claiming to be in Singapore but left to Indonesia. 

I submit to you that there are just too many fake users with questionable intentions in CMB. They all have certain patterns:

1. Their English language usage is simple and sometimes terrible (you can also see from how they write their profile)
2. Fail to prove as a human being by saying ""I don't use Facebook"" or their account is hacked. If they ask for your Whatsapp number, don't give it until you verify everything. Use another chat app.

So I'm building an MVP and basically the way it works is that to avoid getting stood up or chatting forever and never going on a date, I'm setting a timer where once you start chatting with your match you have 48 hours to set a date. MVP also suggests date locations to avoid those convos of ""Come over to my place, I don't have roommates"" (I'm not that easy, hun) and you can soft-track to venue so you \*know\* you're not about to get ghosted/stood up.

Matching will be based on location, mutual interests, and NO SWIPING! Oh yeah and the soft-track to venue just means each party will see the distance they're to the location. As a woman myself, I understand this is of great concern, so I'm thinking of adding a feature where you share your date details via SMS to like a friend or trusted contact.

**TL;DR You match, trigger a timer to set a date within 48 hours of starting chat, you set location with the help of app suggesting venues/themes, you soft-track to venue, enjoy your date!**

&amp;#x200B;

Over 2 years ago, 29 year old me was going through some frustration with online dating. I tried it all. POF, Tinder, Hinge, all to no avail. The people I met seemed like they didn't know what they wanted and to be honest, I don't think I did. Was going through a quarter life crisis and was in a rut. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided, time to work on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I downloaded CMB in support of some of my guys who wanted to share bagels with one another so we could all get more matches. We had a group of like 4-5 guys. And it was a fun thing to do when noon hit. We'd all share what we found for the day and was a fun bonding experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

It took about a month or two for me to get some matches going to where we actually went out. Maybe that was my fault for not pulling the trigger earlier in the convos of you know, actually meeting for coffee or something. But finally happened. Two dates with two girls in one week. I was ecstatic. 

&amp;#x200B;

1st date went awesome. Better than I had expected. But I didn't think that we were relationship compatible. Friends it felt more like. 

&amp;#x200B;

2nd date... went fan freaking tastic. 

So much so, we're living together now. I recently purchased a ring to propose to my future fiancé. Life makes sense now, it's as if I found my missing piece to my puzzle. And I couldn't be more happy right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

So to sum everything up. When it gets frustrating and you feel like you want to quit. Just know, your life long bagel can be a day or week or month or year away. But whenever they do come, it makes all the trouble and hoops to jump through worth it. 

  
Good luck everyone! I hope that you all experience this feeling as well soon!

Not quite a month ago, I went on a first date with a guy who seemed very smooth and suave in his communication. He did not seem terribly interested in asking me about myself but insisted that we meet up as soon as possible. I figured maybe he was shy. 

We agreed to meet at a coffee shop and sat down to talk.

Thankfully we were in a public place and I did not fear for my personal safety, though he did make me uncomfortable.

for some reason, I've been logged out of my CMB account , and I can't log back in. 

Everything was fine yesterday, but when I tried logging in today, I was redirected to the main site, where you're required to login by entering either your FB-account-information or your phone number. Since the first option is closed for me, as I don't have a FB-account, I tried the second route. However, whenever I would receive a verification code via SMS and enter it into the app, I would get an error message and would be re-directed to the main site. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience? Is there anything I can do to solve this issue? I've already sent an email to the CMB help service, but I haven't yet received a reply from them.

,coffeemeetsbagel,"Name: Brian

Age: 20

Gender: Male

Mood: Random

Sexuality: Straight

Status: Single

Medical Condition: Asperger Syndrome (Autistic)

Slightly

My Personality: People describe me as nice, kind, considerate, helpful, and funny, I am also a bit of an introvert

Things I Dislike: Rudeness, Chores, Loneliness, and my parents.

Some of my hobbies include: PC Gaming, building computers and DIY Projects.

Why I’m here: To make new friends who accept me for who I am and not what they want me to be.

PS: I can be a bit shy at times when I first meet people. I'm not really a good conversation starter. Also I don't like people judging me and getting nervous about why I want what im about to say. The thing that i want is a girl that would let me touch her hair but when I ask and if its ok with them ill do it but thats what im super nervous about is people thinking im a creap when i touch girls hair. I also want someone I can hangout a lot with.

Fun Fact: Im autistic partially and ive created a working Game Maker Studio 2D platformer Space Shooter game with a story in under 6 months. This was a group project of 3 people but my partners blew me off and I had to do the whole project myself. It was cool I learned alot from programming a game. I just wish i had some help with it. But I did get the best score out of all the other projects.

I have an essay about the positive aspect of my past life experience just ask and ill share the link with you.

I also have the negative aspect of my past life experience just ask and ill share the link with you.

Experience so far on COB: Hasn't been the hottest to say the least. In a span of 6+ months, I have gotten 2 likes, both matched, one was due to meeting in the past and the other ended before I even checked it.

Pictures: My pictures are at best ... okay. Most of the photos of me are pretty goofy so its hard to scavenge a good looking photo

Profile: I have taken two different approaches towards my profile, a straight forward answer to who I am, what i like, and what I like in my date. And then I took another approach by being kinda goofy with it.

Straight forward:

I am... I am an ENFP and was born in the West Coast. A bubble tea enthusiast who loves to make people laugh.

I like.... to go out on late night trips with friends, hopefully for some KBBQ and Bubble Tea. I love to cook, play sports (badminton, basketball, baseball), play boardgames/videogames, and real talk with friends.

I appreciate when my date … Is true to themselves, is kind to others, and has a great laugh

&amp;#x200B;

Goofish:

I am… The awkward looking man that poses before today, Don't let that geekish smile fool you, under the facade is an undercover bubble tea enthusiast who has an uncanny urge to make others laugh. Rumors have it that he’s really down to earth and acts silly so use that to your advantage.

I like… To make people choke … on laughter. If I’m feeling a little dangerous, I might go out to the dangerous late night world with friends for some KBBQ or bubble tea. When I decide to be safe from the dangerous world, I enjoy cooking (cooking emoji), playing boardgames/videogames, or just having conversations with friends.

I appreciate when my date … Is true to themselves, is kind to others, and has a funny bone. Hopefully here for the long run and also appreciate sales cause FOR A LOW LOW PRICE OF ONE LIKE YOU’LL RECEIVE A NICE CONVERSATION.

,coffeemeetsbagel,"I use CMB on Android, Galaxy S8+. I'm dismayed to find that 2 years after I started using it the bugs I first encountered haven't been addressed at all. **Therefore, I have come here to rant about it, in the hope that someone at CMB actually gives a crap about their user experience.** 

&amp;#x200B;

1. MISSING CHAT MESSAGES IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. How do you mess up the most crucial part of a dating app and just ignore it for years? Multiple times I have sent an outgoing message that simply does not show up in my chat window, and I have no idea whether the other person received it and it's just missing on my end. How do I know if I'm about to send two messages about the same thing and she got both? Embarrassing. 
EVEN WORSE, a match will send me a message, and though I'll get a notification and see the preview of the message in my notifications bar, when I open the app to read the message isn't there! I'm left confused as to whether I got a message or not - until hours or even days later when the message finally shows up, and it looks to my match like I've just ignored her. Even more embarrassing. 
These happened in many memorable instances years ago when I first started using the app... it also happened this week with a new match, in both directions. I absolutely do not trust CMB to facilitate communication.  

2. STUCK ON LOADING SCREEN EVERY APP OPEN. I mean this happens EVERY SINGLE TIME I open the app, whether its been properly closed before or just switching back. The blue loading screen with the logo in white will stay open and showing even though nothing is loading, until I hit my phone's 'back' button, whereupon it immediately leaves the loading screen. It doesn't break essential functionality like problem 1 does, but holy hell is it annoying, and it really speaks to the quality of your dev team.

3. UNWANTED **CONSTANT** PUSH NOTIFICATIONS. You give 3 options for granular notifications control in Settings. I have only one selected, 'Chats'. So why am I getting **literally 5-10 notifications per da**y that have nothing to do with receiving new chat messages? I really dont want multiple reminders that I should send each person I match with another message, or to break the ice, or that it's f\*\*\*g 'Watermelon Day' or whatever pathetic attention grabbing message CMB marketing is trying out. It has the opposite of the intended effect - now I just ignore my CMB notifications, and I'm about to disable them altogether, meaning I won't know if I actually got a new chat message until I manually check.

But as a fellow programmer please believe me when I tell you that these issues alone make your app by far the WORST from a design/dev perspective out of all the competitors, and I'm about to uninstall in frustration.",t2_gyjbc,False,,0,False,"After 2 years of use, STILL: missing messages, unwanted notifications, faulty loading screen",[],r/coffeemeetsbagel,False,6,,0,,False,t3_eve99p,False,dark,0.67,,public,5,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,self,1580288605.0,,[],{},,,True,,1580284732.0,text,6,,,text,self.coffeemeetsbagel,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use CMB on Android, Galaxy S8+. I&amp;#39;m dismayed to find that 2 years after I started using it the bugs I first encountered haven&amp;#39;t been addressed at all. &lt;strong&gt;Therefore, I have come here to rant about it, in the hope that someone at CMB actually gives a crap about their user experience.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MISSING CHAT MESSAGES IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. How do you mess up the most crucial part of a dating app and just ignore it for years? Multiple times I have sent an outgoing message that simply does not show up in my chat window, and I have no idea whether the other person received it and it&amp;#39;s just missing on my end. How do I know if I&amp;#39;m about to send two messages about the same thing and she got both? Embarrassing. 
EVEN WORSE, a match will send me a message, and though I&amp;#39;ll get a notification and see the preview of the message in my notifications bar, when I open the app to read the message isn&amp;#39;t there! I&amp;#39;m left confused as to whether I got a message or not - until hours or even days later when the message finally shows up, and it looks to my match like I&amp;#39;ve just ignored her. Even more embarrassing. 
These happened in many memorable instances years ago when I first started using the app... it also happened this week with a new match, in both directions. I absolutely do not trust CMB to facilitate communication.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;STUCK ON LOADING SCREEN EVERY APP OPEN. I mean this happens EVERY SINGLE TIME I open the app, whether its been properly closed before or just switching back. The blue loading screen with the logo in white will stay open and showing even though nothing is loading, until I hit my phone&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;back&amp;#39; button, whereupon it immediately leaves the loading screen. It doesn&amp;#39;t break essential functionality like problem 1 does, but holy hell is it annoying, and it really speaks to the quality of your dev team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNWANTED &lt;strong&gt;CONSTANT&lt;/strong&gt; PUSH NOTIFICATIONS. You give 3 options for granular notifications control in Settings. I have only one selected, &amp;#39;Chats&amp;#39;. So why am I getting &lt;strong&gt;literally 5-10 notifications per da&lt;/strong&gt;y that have nothing to do with receiving new chat messages? I really dont want multiple reminders that I should send each person I match with another message, or to break the ice, or that it&amp;#39;s f***g &amp;#39;Watermelon Day&amp;#39; or whatever pathetic attention grabbing message CMB marketing is trying out. It has the opposite of the intended effect - now I just ignore my CMB notifications, and I&amp;#39;m about to disable them altogether, meaning I won&amp;#39;t know if I actually got a new chat message until I manually check. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I'm someone clinically diagnosed of paranoia recently and of course (i think) that comes with general anxiety disorder.

I used to be very fit and strong, no abs just toned enough to be confident about myself, but after the medicines that I've been taking, it gave my body a 40 lb boost which is borderline obese in my case. I'm very insecure now about my body, but other than that I've been doing fine with daily activities. I still write songs, play board games, listen to good music, work hard, and a lot more.

I feel very lonely though. I've only been hanging out with the female friends I know and most of them aren't exactly the types that I would hang out with frequently. And to be honest, I really miss doing fun stuff in bed with someone great (I came from a bad breakup 4 months ago).

I read from a Quora answer that you had to have your best angles on display, have your full body as your primary pic, no pictures over a year old, and a lot more. I can't give those out yet and it makes me depressed because I think that even if I do exercise again (I'm already watching my diet), my face isn't really that amazing...

On dating apps it's pretty typical for guys to post their shirtless pics to show off their bodies.

For guys, what motivates you to post them? And what are your objectives on CMB (serious relationship, casual dating, strictly hookups, seeing where things go, etc.)?

No judgement, you want what you want, right? 😆

For girls, what are your thoughts when you see a guy with a shirtless pic on his profile? Are you more likely to like them or to swipe left?

Me, personally, I feel like you probably are looking for hookups if you do this (excluding things like beach pics or something). I usually think this more so if you have multiple shirtless pictures and hardly any bio...so then I swipe left lol.

&lt;p&gt;On dating apps it&amp;#39;s pretty typical for guys to post their shirtless pics to show off their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For guys, what motivates you to post them? And what are your objectives on CMB (serious relationship, casual dating, strictly hookups, seeing where things go, etc.)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No judgement, you want what you want, right? 😆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For girls, what are your thoughts when you see a guy with a shirtless pic on his profile? Are you more likely to like them or to swipe left?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me, personally, I feel like you probably are looking for hookups if you do this (excluding things like beach pics or something). I usually think this more so if you have multiple shirtless pictures and hardly any bio...so then I swipe left lol.

,coffeemeetsbagel,"Hey everybody,

I signed up for CMB about 6 months, found I was getting extremely frustrated after a few weeks without any matches. I put a lot of thought into my profile descriptions; tried to be evenhanded: equal parts serious and funny. Decided it would be best to take a break, work through my frustrations, then return. A few weeks later, matched with two women, one of whom didn't respond to my greeting and the other immediately left the chat room. In response, I decided to alter my description and write out a secret-paths style mini-adventure with references to my all time favorite game, FFVII. I'm not expecting to get matches, hell, I'd be surprised if women took my profile seriously, but it was a spontaneous act of creativity and I definitely wanted to take advantage. 

I'm not asking why I'm getting so few matches, even with a 25 mile radius centered in San Francisco, because no one can really answer that question. I'm asking if anybody else has had the experience of being on this app for extended periods with very little matches. I still receive about 8 bagels a day and have been for weeks, but being matched seems like a chore. 

And no, my filters aren't strict; I generally like any bagel that doesn't have traditional/restrictive gender roles as a requirement. So anyone who has anything similar to ""is a true gentleman"", or ""holds the door open for me"", or ""initiates comversation"" or generally displays an interest in a one-sided power structure.

So far:

22 matches

15 first messages sent (14 by me, 1 by a match!)

12 responses

10 ""real"" conversations

3 dates planned so far, though I suspect all of the conversations could lead to dates

1 conversation I had given up on; we exchanged 2-3 messages each after matching and nothing otherwise until she suddenly gave me her number right before the chat expired. I'm not sure what to make of this.

The age of my matches range from 25-32, although the vast majority fall between 28-30.

In hindsight, using the app around Christmas was probably not the best idea as most people are busy and traveling, myself included.

,coffeemeetsbagel,"Hi all,

Earlier this year, a friend recommended Coffee Meets Bagel to me, and I thought I would give it a try.

I found it quite disappointing.  
None of the 'suggested bagels' the app gave me daily interested me, so I often liked guys who were in the ""discover"" section (or whatever it's called, I forget now). I would frequently run out of ""coffee beans"" before they got refilled, and I was constantly finding ways to get more beans, but sometimes I still did not have enough.

One day, I noticed a guy who was outside of my suggested bagels who I was really, REALLY interested in based on his bio, his basic information including education, age, etc, and his appearance. I also happen to have a rather unusual...preference, shall we say, and he happened to be someone who could accommodate that based on his bio. Here's the thing, though. I did not have enough coffee beans to like him, so I had to buy them.  
I was very upset that I had to pay for said ""beans"". Even though it was not a lot of money, it was still money that I--spoiler alert--ended up losing. You guys, I could have bought an \*actual\* coffee with this money, but no, it went to waste.  
I feel strongly that it is unacceptable for a dating app to charge money to like someone if you don't have enough 'beans'. I have tried a handful of other dating apps and while they do have features you do have to pay for, this is the only app I have ever used that required me to pay for liking someone, and I ended up losing the money.

Have any of you had a similar experience? What are your thoughts?

Awhile ago, I got matched with this guy who sent me 3 flowers through the app, so it got pushed to the front of my queue. Because of that, it did manage to get my attention, and he seemed like a charming guy from his profile and photos, so we ended up exchanging info to carry out conversation via text. 

I actually texted him first, but as a disclaimer, I told him I'm not the greatest texter because of work and when I get home, a lot of times I just leave my phone in my purse to work on YouTube projects on my computer. Video editing has been a passion project for me lately so I just don't wait by my phone that much. But still! I become a lot better when I am actively texting with someone because of CMB.  


But after that first text, he sends me a text the next day like 'ok cool.' I thought it was so bizarre that I found a worst texter than me. I respond pretty quickly to that (only like an hour and legitly because I didn't see it until then), but then it's like another day before he responds.    


We were finally trying to schedule a meetup but when I asked him the details, he took another half day to respond. I responded pretty much right after that because I knew he must be near his phone at that point. Then it's morning of the supposed date when he finally responds, and at that point, I'm just irritated because I can't be expected to shift everything that day (Saturday) to accommodate his last-minuteness. I suggest the next day, Sunday anytime, and I figure if he can't work with that, I don't think I'd want to be with him anyway since he doesn't seem to value my time / schedule.  


We finally meet up and it was alright, but then I tell him it's really bizarre how he has probably a worse texting habit than I do. Then he says that he actually has his phone next to him all the time. He just responds like that because I said my responses would be like that.   


LOL WTF.   


First off, I actually responded to him quite quickly. I think the most it took me to respond was like two hours and when we were trying to figure out the date details, it was like 10 minutes. He took 6 hours, 8 hrs, etc. to respond to me.  

Second of all - I always respond when I see the message. I just wanted to say upfront when I get busy, don't get freaked if I don't respond right away. I knew some guys who did and took it as a sign I wasn't interested. I just honestly get really busy!!  


Needless to say, I left that date with no intention in following up with him despite him wanting to. I guess I have to respect that he was honest telling me he is always on his phone, but I do not respect the fact that he was interested but didn't text until very calculated blocks of time passed. You might call me the asshole for not  being the greatest texter first, but that's a flaw I'm working on.

,coffeemeetsbagel,"Perhaps venting so please disregard if you do not find useful.

Two things specifically I do not like about CMB as a male:

1) Women seem to be the primary customers of the platform itself, while men are the product - height, ethnicity, and profession are recommended/required data points (social capital) but there's no requirement for bust-waist-hip measurements or current weight or body fat ratios (sexual capital). While the dominance of  photos infers all this information, there's no requirement that the photos be current, structured to showcase body physical features (i.e. 360 degree full-body), nor is there any sortability of physical data aside from height (in this respect at least OKC was honest enough to include an attempt at ""attractiveness/hotness"" in their premium offerings). While both social and sexual capital are important, in my experience the majority genders view the priority of each differently.

2) The ""likes you"" tab is aimed at women and is evidence of the economic incentive structure - My understanding is that men receive a large pool of generic/calculated suggestions while women only see suggestions that have already ""liked"" first and in a far lower quantity, with a significant portion overflowing into the ""Discover"" tab. If that's the case then the only majority gender to benefit from this tab functionality will be women.

One overarching big major takeaway from the whole idea of dating platforms in general:

By FAR the biggest take-away from this kind of software design to me is how poorly this Silicon Valley-style ""innovation"" compares with the actual social concept of dating itself.

Our algorithm categorizes your set preferences as “must-haves” in Suggested. Later, the algorithm will use additional info, such as your interests, social circles, education levels, and more, to make educated choices about your best bagels.

But because it considers your set preferences as dealbreakers, this means our algorithm won’t suggest anyone who is even slightly outside of your preferences. For example, if there’s someone attractive nearby who shares your interests, but they’re just one year older than the age preference you set, our algorithm can’t consider them as a potential match.

In short: too many specific criteria → smaller pool of bagels for algorithm to work with → less quality matches.

(A) said she was goofy, so I tried to make silly goofy conversation. Dead.

(C) not much to go on, and she's laid back and considerate, so I toned it down. She's in real estate, so am I. So I tried to find common ground there. Dead.

25 Years Old Male

I AM...
An ESTJ. I was born and raised in the OC and can speak three different languages. There is a good chance I'll be able to greet your parents! You'll be surprised at how much I like singing and karaoking in the shower and car to songs like ""I Want It That Way."" My friends say my best trait is patience, so if you want to wait 3 hours in line for that new dessert place, I’ll bring the lawn chairs! Let's chat so we can potentially meet up for some boba, coffee, tea, beer, wine, cocktail, etc. I'm open to all!

I LIKE...
Grabbing a drink or two with my friends, spontaneous random adventures that involves plane rides, and attending sports events. I love travelling and enjoying the scenery and beauty of each new city. While I enjoy going out, I also value the time spent in!

I APPRECIATE WHEN MY DATE...

&lt;p&gt;25 Years Old Male&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I AM...
An ESTJ. I was born and raised in the OC and can speak three different languages. There is a good chance I&amp;#39;ll be able to greet your parents! You&amp;#39;ll be surprised at how much I like singing and karaoking in the shower and car to songs like &amp;quot;I Want It That Way.&amp;quot; My friends say my best trait is patience, so if you want to wait 3 hours in line for that new dessert place, I’ll bring the lawn chairs! Let&amp;#39;s chat so we can potentially meet up for some boba, coffee, tea, beer, wine, cocktail, etc. I&amp;#39;m open to all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I LIKE...
Grabbing a drink or two with my friends, spontaneous random adventures that involves plane rides, and attending sports events. I love travelling and enjoying the scenery and beauty of each new city. While I enjoy going out, I also value the time spent in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I APPRECIATE WHEN MY DATE...

,coffeemeetsbagel,"Female here, and have been using CMB for bit over a month now. Couple of things I still don't quite understand, hoping to get some insight here.

The app has three tabs:

1. **Suggested**: Usually get \~10 profiles each day. Some of these have already 'Liked' me, others haven't.
2. **Discover**: More profiles and can apply a filter. Costs me beans to 'Like' a profile here. Occasionally there will be a profile on the top that has already 'Liked' me.
3. **Chats**: New chat appears here immediately after liking a profile that has already 'Liked' me (from the Suggested/Discover tab)

I understand the difference between **Suggested** and **Discover** tabs is that the former is profiles of guys that fit the preference I set up, and the latter being guys that don't quite fit the preference.

Some questions...

**Q1:** In the **Suggested** and **Discover** tab, if I like a profile that hasn't yet liked me (so a chat doesn't immediately appear), what happens?

* Does my profile then show up on the guy's side as a profile that has 'Liked' him already?
* If the guy then 'Likes' me back, will a chat automatically appear in my **Chats** tab?

I like...

Hiking big mountains, bouldering indoor mountains, biking, late night runs, live indie music, playing recreational sports, dancing with no rhythm, and trying anything new.

Alternate title of this news bulletin: 

""Unattractive Girl Signs Up For Dating App, Is Disappointed, Displays World's Best Pikachu Face""

All right, don't get me wrong. I'm not here to post some diatribe bitching and whining about how everyone's sexist and shallow and everyone else needs to change to suit my ego. I suppose I just wanted to share.

I'm new to dating apps, and CMB is the first one I've tried. I got it because a friend of mine had been spending our time together gazing starry-eyed into some blissful abyss that only she could see - apparently drowning in fantasies of her new bagel.

When she told me this, I gave her The Look and said something about how if she was that hungry, she could just say so, and we'd go get her a damn bagel.

So then she explained, and I found that she was not hungry. She was super thirsty. And that thirst was getting all kinds\of quenched.

I thought she was ballsy. Personally, I've been spending the last year or so getting my mental health back on track. Anxiety meds, yay! Meditation, yay! Occasionally sleeping, yay! Going outside sometimes... y...yay? Bed Bath and Beyond... fuck yeah.

I've especially been working on self worth and insecurity, but I'm not a terribly social creature. All my hobbies are Alpha-Introvert things and I'm much more shy around strangers offline than through text or chat. So the idea of joining CMB didn't occur to me until about a month ago when I had a sudden revelation.

""I've been badly wanting a meaningful relationship and struggling with finding a way to connect to others, but I didn't think of joining a dating app because I didn't think anyone would ever want me.""

It wasn't a thought I'd ever consciously had before this. It was just a belief, held as truth, as sure in my bones as 'grass is green,' 'dogs say bark/woof/arf,' and '50 Shades is an abomination for what it did to kink culture more than for being a trashfire of writing.' 

So, I decided to make that leap. I contacted a photographer buddy of mine who heroically took me through a montage of taking my picture. And you know what? Not a single lens cracked, no dogs ran howling from my general location, and locusts did not fall from the sky. I noticed that I have lovely eyes, all big and expressive. I felt a glimmer of sensation in the pit of my stomach that, for once, was not a case of Gondor Calls For Pepto Bismol. It was hope. Even a modicum of excitement.

I put my heart and soul into my tiny little profile. Every sentence was true, and I was proud of myself. It wasn't so long ago that my photographer friend found me lying on my bed, ugly crying and looking like a tranquilized cow. I'd just been dumped for being too clingy. She asked me, ""Who are you?"" 

""\[My name\]?""

""Yeah, but who are you? Repeat after me: I am...""

""I am...""

""Now tell me three facts about yourself. And if you just repeat 'now tell me three things about yourself,' I will bitchslap you into next week.""

And I couldn't think of three positive things. But filling this out, I was able to see a lot of wonderful things about myself. Valuable things. Not even generic ""I'm a nice girl and I like dogs and you should be friends with me (but it's okay if you don't want to)."" I could see someone worth connecting with. Someone worth choosing.

I made my profile and went to sleep, heart in my throat for the next day.

Noon came. Nothing really happened.

""Well, it's just been a day,"" I told myself, ""and they say this app moves slowly. Maybe tomorrow.""

But things just kept going that way. I stayed hopeful, because I could see worth, damn it. I was a cliche Dove commercial in the motherfucking flesh. My flesh may be pale as hell but that just makes it easier for the inner light of fantabulosity to shine right through that translucent shit.

Yet still, people don't really reach out. I'm not a girl who must sit back and wait for contact like Princess Peach before she learned how to skewer turtles on her parasol. I reached out. I'd send messages that barely fit in the character limit. Tailored to each person specifically. I never, ever clicked the like button without one. But still no one spoke back. It was like screaming into a void filled with an abundance of seriously hot people and a few handfuls of average people (seriously, what's with 90% of the people here being CW hot?) only for people to glance my way and then quickly look away as though I had forgotten pants that day and they were embarrassed for me.

And I browse the forums.

And I see people lamenting the way that they don't see any attractive chicks on CMB. 7/10 and above. ""Uggos everywhere,"" people say. Like people like me are basically plague rats, except less fuckable.

I was forced to come to an unpleasant conclusion, one which was and is unfortunately true.

I'm one of the Undesirables. Because I'm fat, and while my eyes may be frivolously big and expressive... so are Mr. Potato Head's.

I've been losing weight for a few months now. I'm not unaware of how to do it, and I'm not loath to do so, but it takes time. And I do know it's that. My pictures are good, and I like to think I express myself on my profile well. But to see that, people have to read it and not instapass on me. That is the struggle.

It makes me sad to think that I might be un-date-able until I've lost weight, even though I genuinely do think I'm a pretty cool woman these days. 

I'm sure there are people out there who'd look past that, but the thought keeps popping into my head: with all these preferences, it's almost like someone can place an order for their ideal partner, then scroll around until they find the closest thing to that, with acceptable garnish and not too steep a price tag.

And that's okay.

No one is obligated to be attracted to me. My weight is my fault. Someday, it won't be a problem anymore, and that will be the ironically named land of milk and honey.

I guess I'm just writing to say that it's hard, sometimes, to maintain the idea that I'm worth choosing. And loving. And wanting. Worth being judged on more than just my ""snowman clothed in cocaine-dipped cottonballs"" looks.

Because none of you have heard anything like this before, right? It's totally an original complaint. While I'm at it, what's the deal with airline food?

To conclude... what am I to do now? Do I give up? I could delete CMB and slink back to my hovel where the internet seems to think I belong, to hiss at passersby unless they pay my toll? Resign myself to being untouchable until I've un-binge-eaten years worth of pizza rolls?

Fuck that.

I still have faith.

Because to dance with despair is to court hungry dragons, and as choice a meal I'd be for one, it is cordially invited to fuck itself on a scenic tour of hell.

Maybe no one cares, and maybe this post will be lol-fodder. I'm still cynical enough to worry that, if anyone notices this long ass post, it will be to jeer at me through the anonymity of the interwebs... and honest enough to acknowledge that if that's the case, I'll probably delete this and sulk for a few hours. For the moment, though, getting this off my chest has helped, and I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to do so here.

But if you happen to be in the vicinity of Buttfuck Nowhere - located in the picturesque city of AnonymityBecauseChickenshit (it's in central Michigan, check your maps) and you feel like saying hi, log on and give it a whirl. You'll know you've found me when you come upon a picture that completely blinds you and everyone in your life starts calling you Helen Keller.

Daily I get the usual 6 suggested and 5 discoveries who have liked me first:

Day 1-3: I was being difficult, I pass 100% on all my bagels

Day 4-6

* I matched with 2 A/A+ bagel with little profile info
* I matched with 2 B/B+ bagel with decent profile info

Day 6-7: I matched with 2 C/C+ bagel that seems eager to talk (they send message with the like, down to earth profile)

I guess I'm B, (may be B+) from the occasional flowers and kind of profiles that liked me first: 15% are A; 20-30% are B ; 60% are instant pass

I'm not the kind of woman to expect the man to do all the work, I initiated all conversations (6 people, I matched with)

* I get it that A profiles never answer, because they have so much better choice vs. the B that I am
* I kind understand that B profile might be engaged: They either don't answer, if they do its muted boring conversation with them answering as I asked and then die down
* But C also doesn't answer

So I have 2 theories on this:

CMB sucks:

* Guy get 21 suggested and girls get 6: So girls have so much backlog that by the time she matches, weeks or days have passed and the guy might have lost interest. The slow dating concept is nice in theory but kills up the urgency to connect.
* There is issue with the chat system (I know there is a lot of glitch), One of the C guy who sent a message with the like gave me his whatsapp numbers (and he also ignore my chat on CMB app)
* I read somewhere that people dont get notification, so they simply don't know when they receive messages

&amp;#x200B;

Its not the app, it's me and online dating in general

* That's just the sad reality of online dating, not just CMB, people are simply disengaged
* So much ghosting due to failed attempt making any genuine connection difficult

,coffeemeetsbagel,"The plural of anecdote is not data, but I've heard enough anecdotes about Asian males' experiences on Coffee Meets Bagel that I thought I'd share my own experience for the benefit of others in a similar position to me.

TL;DR: despite liking far fewer girls on Hinge than CMB, I have five simultaneous matches on Hinge with two scheduled dates after long, interesting conversations; this doesn't even count a match from several weeks ago that led to two dates but ultimately not a great personality fit (my decision, not hers.)  Over the same timeframe with CMB, I have zero, zilch, nada - despite being a seemingly very eligible date prospect - and despite even paying for beans and using them in different ways (""boost,"" ""take"") and diligently checking and liking most of my Bagels every single day.

There is no complaint here; it's simply a ""chin up"" message to anyone who has had a similar experience to myself as an Asian male (i.e., it gets better... if you use other apps.)  Although I recognize that my experience might be specific to me / my circumstances / my geographic area / etc, I've heard similar stories from people I know.

I've used Coffee Meets Bagel on multiple occasions (early 20s and now mid-20s.)  I'm certainly not perfect, but everyone in my life would agree that I'm very eligible.  I have a STEM undergraduate degree and a master's degree in a different (serious) professional field, and I have a grown-up job that pays six figures.  I live in a major metropolitan area with many millions of people and no shortage of eligible female Bagels.  There's nothing offensive, weird, or awkward on my profile; it's definitely not bland or stereotypical.  I have no clue how to rate myself on the 10-point scale (certainly not a 9 or 10), but I know I'm not hideously unattractive (i.e. I'm at least a 6-7 if the scale equates to deciles); I've had plenty of girls have crushes on me over the course of my life, and I'm in good shape / outdoorsy / etc.  I'm not 6 feet tall and am slightly shorter than the average American male, but I'm modestly above the average height for an Asian-American male, depending on which data set you look at.  I'm not awkward or too serious or overtly arrogant / braggadocious; I make all my friends and family laugh and am generally a good conversationalist.  Etc.

I have pictures of myself with friends, smiling, alone without sunglasses, doing interesting stuff, full body shots so people can see my physique, etc.  I even have pictures with dogs (which is basically cheating, right?)  I could probably get slightly better pictures but short of hiring a professional photographer for a photoshoot, I doubt it would make that much of a difference.

Whenever I'm matched with someone, I am polite, often address people by name (occasionally enough to be friendly but not often enough to be creepy), ask specific questions about their interests, make reasonably funny jokes / comments, stay away from any behavior that could remotely be construed as inappropriate, etc - basically all the standard Dale Carnegie type stuff.

Both times I've been on CMB, after diligently swiping on all of my Bagels for weeks on end and being pretty open minded about who I swiped on (basically ""liking"" anyone educated with a professional job, or anyone still in college / grad school), I had a handful of early matches but nothing that turned into anything; after the initial spike, it fizzled away into basically no matches, and the few initial matches didn't really go anywhere - several ghosted entirely; a few responded once or twice and then not again.  This is even after using the ""beans"" to use the ""Boost"" function on multiple occasions (I was willing to burn the money).  I had one fluke date off CMB but it was with a girl who ""Discovered"" me, but that wasn't a result of the app's suggestion feature and I view it mostly as luck (it also wasn't with someone who I would remotely be compatible with - she's not my type at all.)

The first time I was on CMB, I quit because it was so depressing - the app literally damaged my self-worth (i.e., am I that horribly unattractive?) - and I'm almost there this time.

Is it me?  Or is it the app?  It could be either.  Some more data: I currently have five (five!) separate conversations going with matches on Hinge, all of whom have responded to initial messages, two of which have been quite extensive conversations with dates scheduled.  I've literally stopped swiping because I couldn't keep up another conversation if I wanted to (which I don't; five is quite enough.)  I'm actively hoping, at this point, that none of my other swipes turn into matches, because I don't have time for that many people at once.  This comes after one match with Hinge a few weeks ago that was a great conversation and turned into two dates, but ultimately ended up being not a great fit.

And I'm quite picky (though not the same way many guys are, i.e. physical appearance is far less important to me) - all of the girls have graduate education and/or professional jobs, and both of the scheduled dates are with people with significant shared common interests (outdoors activities, reading, etc.)  I have high standards and am not just throwing myself at anyone willing to talk to me - I automatically ""dislike"" profiles if they aren't educated, don't have a real job, have inappropriate profile text or sexualized pictures, etc - or if they just seem like they wouldn't make any sense (""I love Jesus,"" ""bet you can't outdrink me,"" etc.)

I generally try to take responsibility for all things in my life; I am dead last (in terms of people I know) to complain about external circumstances - whether or not they are real challenges, I view it as my job to overcome them.  So I've tried to a/b test a number of settings within CMB (as well as change a number of elements on my profile (text, pictures, order of pictures, etc.)  I have genuinely tried to do everything I can do to maximize my chances.  I blamed myself, and not the app, for a very long time.  But literally nothing has done anything to make my experience with the app better, either time.  Remember that guy who created a LinkedIn profile for a fish and it got job offers?  Well, if my CMB profile was for a fish, it couldn't do any worse than my existing profile.

I am, of course, open to the idea that I suck at creating a dating profile, that my pictures are horrible or I'm profoundly unattractive, etc.  However, this set of explanations seems improbable considering that I'm getting lots of matches on Hinge - turning into great conversations and actual dates - with exactly the type of girls I was hoping to meet on CMB (educated, driven, etc .)  My pictures on Hinge are the exact same; the order is the exact same.  The style / personality of responses is similar (I actually think my CMB profile is a better descriptor of who I am and what I'm about; the Hinge prompts are really stupid, IMO.)  But despite cumulatively liking far fewer girls on Hinge, I've gotten way more matches, which have gone much farther than the few matches I did get on CMB.

I'm not sure what it is about CMB, but despite being started by the Asian-American sisters, it seems to be a hard app for Asian males to use, even given the known challenges of being an Asian male on dating apps, and even IF you only set Asian females as your preference (which gives you the highest probability of being ""liked"" back, per the widely discussed OKCupid data on response rates by race pair).  FWIW, I have had better results on Hinge selecting only East Asian / South Asian races (as opposed to all races I would actually prefer to set) because you get a higher match rate per swipe - but messing around with these settings on CMB doesn't seem to have helped.

This issue keeps coming up with CMB.  There's me, my cousin (who has a similar profile - nice guy, graduate degree with a respected professional job, very polite and personable), the comment by u/lolomg on the post on this subreddit by u/nottalobsta a year ago, etc.  In all cases, there seemed to be nothing wrong with the guy - but something about the app's design, algorithm, or whatever made it extremely challenging (close to impossible) to find appropriate matches.  Either my profile literally isn't getting shown to any girls at all, or something about the app's design makes the exact same kind of girl ""dislike"" me on CMB but ""like"" me on Hinge.

If you've found yourself in this position, I guess my message is - stop banging your head against the wall with something that isn't working and try something else... it's probably not you.  You're probably a perfectly nice, attractive, interesting person who lots of girls (edit: or guys, if that's your thing!) would love to meet.  The problem isn't you.  It's probably Coffee Meets Bagel.  Try Hinge, or OKCupid, or meeting people offline, or literally anything else... I try to be circumspect about conclusions but I do feel pretty strongly, at this point, that there is something about me + CMB that just doesn't work, and this extends to guys who have similar profiles to me (even if they're in very different cities).",t2_43yer7vm,False,,0,False,Asian male - having much better luck on Hinge (YMMV),[],r/coffeemeetsbagel,False,6,,0,,False,t3_cf4ht7,False,dark,0.93,,public,41,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,41,,False,self,1563522462.0,,[],{},,,True,,1563549803.0,text,6,,,text,self.coffeemeetsbagel,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plural of anecdote is not data, but I&amp;#39;ve heard enough anecdotes about Asian males&amp;#39; experiences on Coffee Meets Bagel that I thought I&amp;#39;d share my own experience for the benefit of others in a similar position to me.&lt;/p&gt;

Some more data: I currently have five (five!) separate conversations going with matches on Hinge, all of whom have responded to initial messages, two of which have been quite extensive conversations with dates scheduled.  I&amp;#39;ve literally stopped swiping because I couldn&amp;#39;t keep up another conversation if I wanted to (which I don&amp;#39;t; five is quite enough.)  I&amp;#39;m actively hoping, at this point, that none of my other swipes turn into matches, because I don&amp;#39;t have time for that many people at once.  This comes after one match with Hinge a few weeks ago that was a great conversation and turned into two dates, but ultimately ended up being not a great fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m quite picky (though not the same way many guys are, i.e. physical appearance is far less important to me) - all of the girls have graduate education and/or professional jobs, and both of the scheduled dates are with people with significant shared common interests (outdoors activities, reading, etc.)  I have high standards and am not just throwing myself at anyone willing to talk to me - I automatically &amp;quot;dislike&amp;quot; profiles if they aren&amp;#39;t educated, don&amp;#39;t have a real job, have inappropriate profile text or sexualized pictures, etc - or if they just seem like they wouldn&amp;#39;t make any sense (&amp;quot;I love Jesus,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;bet you can&amp;#39;t outdrink me,&amp;quot; etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I generally try to take responsibility for all things in my life; I am dead last (in terms of people I know) to complain about external circumstances - whether or not they are real challenges, I view it as my job to overcome them.  So I&amp;#39;ve tried to a/b test a number of settings within CMB (as well as change a number of elements on my profile (text, pictures, order of pictures, etc.)  I have genuinely tried to do everything I can do to maximize my chances.  I blamed myself, and not the app, for a very long time.  But literally nothing has done anything to make my experience with the app better, either time.  Remember that guy who created a LinkedIn profile for a fish and it got job offers?  Well, if my CMB profile was for a fish, it couldn&amp;#39;t do any worse than my existing profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am, of course, open to the idea that I suck at creating a dating profile, that my pictures are horrible or I&amp;#39;m profoundly unattractive, etc.  However, this set of explanations seems improbable considering that I&amp;#39;m getting lots of matches on Hinge - turning into great conversations and actual dates - with exactly the type of girls I was hoping to meet on CMB (educated, driven, etc .)  My pictures on Hinge are the exact same; the order is the exact same.  The style / personality of responses is similar (I actually think my CMB profile is a better descriptor of who I am and what I&amp;#39;m about; the Hinge prompts are really stupid, IMO.)  But despite cumulatively liking far fewer girls on Hinge, I&amp;#39;ve gotten way more matches, which have gone much farther than the few matches I did get on CMB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what it is about CMB, but despite being started by the Asian-American sisters, it seems to be a hard app for Asian males to use, even given the known challenges of being an Asian male on dating apps, and even IF you only set Asian females as your preference (which gives you the highest probability of being &amp;quot;liked&amp;quot; back, per the widely discussed OKCupid data on response rates by race pair).  FWIW, I have had better results on Hinge selecting only East Asian / South Asian races (as opposed to all races I would actually prefer to set) because you get a higher match rate per swipe - but messing around with these settings on CMB doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have helped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue keeps coming up with CMB.  There&amp;#39;s me, my cousin (who has a similar profile - nice guy, graduate degree with a respected professional job, very polite and personable), the comment by &lt;a href=""/u/lolomg""&gt;u/lolomg&lt;/a&gt; on the post on this subreddit by &lt;a href=""/u/nottalobsta""&gt;u/nottalobsta&lt;/a&gt; a year ago, etc.  In all cases, there seemed to be nothing wrong with the guy - but something about the app&amp;#39;s design, algorithm, or whatever made it extremely challenging (close to impossible) to find appropriate matches.  Either my profile literally isn&amp;#39;t getting shown to any girls at all, or something about the app&amp;#39;s design makes the exact same kind of girl &amp;quot;dislike&amp;quot; me on CMB but &amp;quot;like&amp;quot; me on Hinge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve found yourself in this position, I guess my message is - stop banging your head against the wall with something that isn&amp;#39;t working and try something else... it&amp;#39;s probably not you.  You&amp;#39;re probably a perfectly nice, attractive, interesting person who lots of girls (edit: or guys, if that&amp;#39;s your thing!) would love to meet.  The problem isn&amp;#39;t you.  It&amp;#39;s probably Coffee Meets Bagel.  Try Hinge, or OKCupid, or meeting people offline, or literally anything else... I try to be circumspect about conclusions but I do feel pretty strongly, at this point, that there is something about me + CMB that just doesn&amp;#39;t work, and this extends to guys who have similar profiles to me (even if they&amp;#39;re in very different cities).&lt;/p&gt;

Using the same distance and age range, each account got the following

FB-linked

* 4 daily matches for first few days, then dropped to 3. 40 discovery matches

Phone

* 5 constant daily matches, 20 discovery matches

,coffeemeetsbagel,"I have been getting ZERO matches for a while. I am not talking about girls liking me back. I mean I am not getting any daily AND discovery. It's really weird, because when I first started it used to bring me a fresh batch of profiles almost every day. Now, I am lucky to get a single daily, let alone a couple. A tiny part of my mind is screaming ""THIS APP IS A SCAM!"", but I have met my ex previously on the app.

So I decided to do a little experiment. I decided my current account linked with Facebook to widen up the preference. (Age, height, distance). I will see if my limited preference was the reason why I've been getting so little matches. 

Meanwhile, I have also created a new account with my phone number. Just like I first joined using my facebook account, it immediately matched me with 4 daily bagels, and a bunch of discoveries.

,coffeemeetsbagel,"Hi,

I met someone on CMB and we have been seeing each other since the beginning of the month. A month or so back, we engaged in the topic of exclusivity. My partner has made it transparent with the continued use of CMB, however has only used it for ‘people seeing’ and has purposely not matched with anyone.

While I do have my personal reasons for suspicions, I have come across this icon and was wondering if anyone could provide insight on if it is CMB or another apps notification icon.

Dishonesty is something that I do not take lightly, and with the recent events of lack of communication and suddenly not having time/wanting to meet me, I want to know if I should be more upfront if the icon really is from the app.

Thanks.

See how awkward the above could be, either via messaging them, or in person? This is EXTREMELY important for SO many people...

I keep wondering why this is NOT part of the Coffee Meets Bagel match profiles – every other dating sites/apps I've been on have this.

I mean... you even have height, religion, occupation listed... I think something as monumental as having children, or knowing if a potential partner wants kids (at some point in time) or doesn't want kids is certainly way more important than those others.

A question like that is also not an ideal first-date type of question (lest they think you're in a super rush, jumping the gun, and/or are unhinged and are already thinking of having children with somebody you JUST met ;) But WITHOUT knowing that bit of information, you're potentially (hate to say it) just wasting peoples time without knowing the answer to something like that which is a deal breaker (on either side, depending) for many, many, people.

Are those numbers right? 6 &amp; 5. Or is there no limit to the # of discover like bagels shown a day?

I also read about the queue where guys are reporting back about matches that take months to complete after they fired off their likes. Is there a queue for the bagels that fit the girls' pref, which goes at 6/d, and a separate one that doesn't fit the girls' pref, which goes at 5/d?

,coffeemeetsbagel,"Started dating this guy a month or so ago. He was super into me at first and we would fool around all the time. But now it's like I'm more of an afterthought. I'm a very busy medical student and he always complains that I'm never available when he wants (usually when he's horny). So I took my exam at school earlier than I usually would even though that meant I would get a lower score. I also finished at 4 am just so I could have all day Saturday to spend time with him. 


So I invited him over today but then he told me he would come over after he finishes watching wrestling on TV. I asked him at 7pm.Iwaited until 10pm and then texted him if he was still coming over. After an hour of no reply I texted him again telling him it was a bit of a turn off considering how long I've waited already. He then tells me the wrestling match on TV won't end until midnight.

At this point I get a little mad at him. I told him i would have understood if he told me from the beginning that I wouldn't expect him until after midnight. The fact the he couldn't even spare me that courtesy made me feel like my time didn't even matter to him. He then told me that he wasn't super invested in this relationship and that we were moving too fast (this coming from the guy who says he's horny all the time) . BUT when I ask him if this means he doesn't want to see me anymore, he says that I ask too much of him. For some reason, he just won't come out and say he wants to end things and I don't know why.

Anyways, I told him to come over and talk to me in person after the wrestling thing ends because I think it's cowardly to try and do this over text.

He was super into me at first and we would fool around all the time. But now it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m more of an afterthought. I&amp;#39;m a very busy medical student and he always complains that I&amp;#39;m never available when he wants (usually when he&amp;#39;s horny). So I took my exam at school earlier than I usually would even though that meant I would get a lower score. I also finished at 4 am just so I could have all day Saturday to spend time with him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I invited him over today but then he told me he would come over after he finishes watching wrestling on TV. I asked him at 7pm.Iwaited until 10pm and then texted him if he was still coming over. After an hour of no reply I texted him again telling him it was a bit of a turn off considering how long I&amp;#39;ve waited already. He then tells me the wrestling match on TV won&amp;#39;t end until midnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I get a little mad at him. I told him i would have understood if he told me from the beginning that I wouldn&amp;#39;t expect him until after midnight. The fact the he couldn&amp;#39;t even spare me that courtesy made me feel like my time didn&amp;#39;t even matter to him. He then told me that he wasn&amp;#39;t super invested in this relationship and that we were moving too fast (this coming from the guy who says he&amp;#39;s horny all the time) . BUT when I ask him if this means he doesn&amp;#39;t want to see me anymore, he says that I ask too much of him. For some reason, he just won&amp;#39;t come out and say he wants to end things and I don&amp;#39;t know why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I told him to come over and talk to me in person after the wrestling thing ends because I think it&amp;#39;s cowardly to try and do this over text. Unless you guys have any tips for me, I guess I&amp;#39;ll update when this is over. &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to quickly share my story: 

I've met my current BF 6 weeks ago on Coffeemeetsbagel. I had had the app for about a year and was finally ready to give up on OLD after dating 25 people for the past year. 

&amp;#x200B;

It just so happened that my last date was THE ONE date which got me my current boyfriend whom I adore. He's sweet, cute, smart, funny and I'm crazy about him. I hope this lasts because I'm very much in love with him and he's said his first ""I love you"" as well ! Already met his friends and family. He's awesome and I like everything about him.

,coffeemeetsbagel,"&gt; Hi XXXX,

&gt; We recently found a bug in our system that was preventing some messages in CMB Chats from being sent or seen. You may have even thought you were ghosted, when in fact your match's message just wasn't appearing! But we've fixed this bug, and your messages are waiting safely for you in Chats. To see any messages you may have missed, please close and then reopen your CMB app.

&gt; We know that not seeing replies from your matches could have been super frustrating. So, we've automatically extended all of your open chats by 7 days, and we're going to gift you 3 free Reopen Chat items that will never expire 💝.
See my chats

&gt; We’re so sorry if this bug has affected the way you connect with your matches. You may want to look back into your chat history — starting from around Feb. 20 — and use your Reopen Chat items on matches you expected to hear back from, but didn’t.

&gt; We hope you can give chatting with your matches another shot and maybe even ask them out!

&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; The CMB Team

Recently received this email from CMB about a buggy messaging experience. Kinda silly for a dating app to not be able to get one of its 2 basic functions right (facilitating communication). 

I haven't seen any new messages show up in the matches I had but how would you know if you've been affected as the sender?

  I met this guy via CMB a month ago. He asked me out on the first night when we chatted on CMB. We didn’t have the chance to meet in person until I was done with my exams. Long story short… our first date lasted 3 hours — we only hugged each other, and he had his arm around my waist. He even planned our second date while we were still on our first date. We continued to snap and message each other each day.

all of a sudden he started asking if I am still a virgin. I said yes, because I am a christian. He then asked how far I was with my previous relationships. I told him everything but sex. He told me that I made the right decision, and he said he thought that a gorgeous woman like me would not be virgin. We then had a long conversation on sex…. like if I have ever thought about sex. 

&amp;#x200B;

Little background: female-23 male-25

&amp;#x200B;

Ok. Are there any red flags here? I don’t have too many relationships so I don’t know if I should continue with this guy. Please help me 

I considered myself to be fairly open minded, but I just want to save my virginity to the right guy. I don’t want to have sex too early in the relationship.

So I (m41) connected with a someone (f34) and it quickly moved from CMB to what'sapp. Her area code was strange but  not unusual give she said she was American (I'm a Canuck, eh) We tried to arrange a meeting before she headed out of town to see her aunt but she cancelled last minute.

 Anywho we're talking a lot while she's there and there seems to be legit chemistry (we were both out of the market for over a year so I was thinking loneliness was factor) So after 2 weeks of this, few days before she's due back she starts asking me for some money to help her get home. Some unexpected expense came up and hell everyone has trouble making ends meet in The Six. She asked to borrow for enough for a flight (500 CND) and I said I couldn't afford it but wanted to help.

I ask for some verification, something to proves she lives here. Her phone is broken so no mic or camera. But I get a full name and see a rough Facebook page with photos that look right. The photos she sent were the same person and reverse image search came back clean.

I get a local number for a landlord (she claims to run a family business so there's no employer to call) and talked to him. And send her 250 CND, enough for a bus ticket and maybe a meal or two for a 14 hour trip.  A week later and she was waiting for the weather to clear up... so like a gentlechump a say screw it give her some more to fly and stay off the icy roads (bringing it up to the original amount of 500 CND) It's not a huge hit, a the whole time I said that it wasn't dependant on sex or a relationship and that I was trying to help someone out in a bind get home safe. Mama may have raised a fool... but a kind-hearted fool. 

Up until two nights ago we were still texting... then my messages stopped getting read. Messages were extremely romantic/love focused, and she was definitely coming on to me, to the point I was trying to put some brakes on.  Here's the thing...there's over 300 messages in the thread seems like a lot of work for a fistful of monopoly money. 

Thoughts? advice? I'm willing to give her name/alias and deets in a PM if  you've had the exact same experience and give the name you got as well. 

I hate to say it but I fell for her entirely... if she were real, she'd be my forever girl. I cancelled all my dating accounts and think I'll give up on women for a while.

Edit looking a timeline it was 28 days of back and forth to get 500 canuck bucks ...

Every week, I am going to post a extreme opposite “A” vs “B” topic of discussion consisting of habits or traits in a partner to let us think what’s important, what we can we live with in a partner, and how this might impact you in a relationship. 

This week, who should you be with:

A) A partner who loves working out. They aren’t a fitness model or body-builder type but they are knowledgeable about the impact of being active physically and mentally. They love the gym, they have a couple of gym memberships, and always make time for a workout even while on vacation. Believes a couple that works out together, stays together.

or

B) A partner who hates working out. They’re almost or already at the dad bod stage (or a female equivalent) but they don’t really care or know about the importance of healthy habits. They prefer to keep activity low: sleeping in, couching it, making sure to get that order of animal style fries with every order. Hates getting sweaty. A walk in the beach might be a hard request but they might do it. Overall, they just want someone to sit with them while watching Game of Thrones. 

Remember, choose one or the other. No in-betweens. Think about the pros and cons, your past dating experience, and just thoughts about dating someone carrying or not carrying these traits. 

Also consider:
- will you do these activities with your partner and would you be happy doing as a couple? 
- Would this play into eating habits
- Would you be okay with someone who doesn’t have the same activity level as you?

I am... :

- A driven &lt;medical career, non doctor here&gt;, who thoroughly enjoys his career.
- A good mix between staying indoors during the week, but being adventurous in his free time. Coding on the computer and walking through nature excite me equally.
- Huge into family and friends. Strong bonds with the people I surround myself with brings me joy.

I like... :

- Intricate coffee: At all times of the day, morning or night. 
- Cars: Driving, fixing, and just admiring.
- Cooking and Baking: Can't deny good food, specially housemade. Signatures include a killer chimichanga and decadent tiramisu.
- Movies and Shows are a must. Sci-fi, Romcoms, Action/Adventure. MCU, P&amp;R, The Office, and BK99 hit the top of my list. Grey's is a guilty pleasure.

I appreciate when my date... :

- Likes to travel: outdoorsy adventures or museums or galleries. Anything that's new will catch my interest. 
- Walks on the beach are overrated. Let's take a drive. Clear roads, good music, and no destination sounds just about perfect.
- Likes food and coffee: I'm always on the lookout for those hole in the wall bites and fancy cafes.

,coffeemeetsbagel,"29 M average looking guy from California here. I joined CMB a few months ago.. in the beginning, it seemed great, and I got lots of matches. ( around 15-20 ) in about 2 months,

but now since past 2-3 weeks, I have stopped getting matches completely. 
Not even a single match. 
I don't know what's wrong. I haven't changed my profile at all. 
My pics, text, location everything is exactly the same but I'm not getting any matches now. 

How is that even possible, I'm still liking almost a same amount of girls and since nothing else has changed from my side, why am I not getting any matches now?? 

Has CMB stopped showing my profile to girls ??

Or have all the girls around me made a new year resolution to not go out with me ?? 😂

I'm on the unpaid version of the app if that matters.

&lt;p&gt;but now since past 2-3 weeks, I have stopped getting matches completely. 
Not even a single match. 
I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s wrong. I haven&amp;#39;t changed my profile at all. 
My pics, text, location everything is exactly the same but I&amp;#39;m not getting any matches now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is that even possible, I&amp;#39;m still liking almost a same amount of girls and since nothing else has changed from my side, why am I not getting any matches now?? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has CMB stopped showing my profile to girls ??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or have all the girls around me made a new year resolution to not go out with me ?? 😂&lt;/p&gt;

26, Major city in the Pacific Northwest

Web Developer

Height: 5'10

Ethnicity: Asian

I am... Always down to watch a classic film. The boxing gym is my second home. If I'm not there, I love trying out new sports. I study film and work in tech.

I like... Classic films (Brief Encounter!) and Asian films (Tokyo Story!), Exploring gardens, Eating healthy, Boxing, Running through the woods, Swimming.

I appreciate it when my date... Is articulate, Passionate about their hobbies, Wants to grab dessert with me \[cake emoji\]

**Context:**

I restarted my account a week ago because I took a bunch of new photos recently. I think my picture with the leather coat is the best one. I think maybe I am not getting matches because I look older than my age (26)? I sometimes get these blank notifications from CMB which I think could be potential matches.

**PREFERENCES**

I have gotten so tired of driving after work, I have changed my distance from 25 miles to 10 miles. My number of matches has shrunk significantly.

**EXPERIENCE**

As of today, here’s what my numbers look like

\--61 Matches

\---37 Actual Conversations

\----17 First Dates

\-----12 Second Dates

\------10 Third Dates

\-------3 Fourth Dates

\--------1 Fifth Date

I thought Fremont Z and I would be perfect for each other. We're both outgoing, run in the same party circles, and we fed off each other's comedic styles. I was completely smitten, like straight up butterflies in my stomach, over Fremont Z, but very recently he mentioned another girl asked him to be exclusive, and he said he couldn't decide between the two of us. I knew I couldn't be with someone so indecisive, so last Friday I told him to just choose her. I knew that even if he had chosen me, I would have always wondered if he was thinkng about her. 

However, as the heavens would have it, I had an amazing Tinder date that Friday night with an adorable nerd that I don't even remember swiping right on. 

Good luck to you all!

,coffeemeetsbagel,"Hi there. I just started this app as a man looking for women, and I'm definitely a bit a confused on how everything works. I'm familiar with bumble and tinder, so I assumed cmb was similar, but it seems a fair bit more complicated

My understanding is that men and women are treated differently on this app. I've used this for four days, and here's what's happened so far. My first day, I had 5 suggested bagels, second 21, third 21, and forth 26, which I haven't started swiping. I've matched with one person so far, and received a ""She likes you"" profile on my discovery page. 

First, is there a cap to the number of suggested bagels? What numbers have you typically seen? I read online that the cap was 21, but then I got 26. I'm extremely selective on swiping (swipe yes on somewhere around 10%), and live in a decent sized city if you'd like to compare that to yourselves.

Second, what is the ""she likes you"" on my discovered page. Is that an option that women get to send (like the incessant give flower popups or superlikes)? Or does that mean all my suggested bagels have not seen me yet?

Third, I have the option to pay for statistics on matches, do women have to pay for this feature as well? I'm assuming most women wouldn't pay for such a thing, but I'd like to know if my, uh... introverted nature will be made apparent.

## I am...

A restless soul, an aspiring creative, and procrastinating on becoming the millionaire-philanthropist I am in my heart.

## I like...

Building things including furniture and electronic gadgets.

Pretending my pocket-sized mirrorless travel camera is a professional DSLR.

Fresh air in the morning and breakfast in the sun.

## I appreciate when my date...

Can help me convince the waiter that we know anything about wine.

Likes getting out of their comfort zone ~~(not on a first date haha)~~, whether in a foreign country or pushing themselves in a new way with something they do every day.

Splitting food at a restaurant so we can try more dishes is the fastest way to my heart.

The lesson I have learned in the last month is that it's okay and possible to simultaneously have fun hooking up, and searching for the one that makes you feel like inactivating your account. I am finding out that it's not as easy to find this combination raver nerd that I originally thought, but the search has been fun so far. 

I have made a handful of good friends through this app, some of which that have become FWBs that I see regularly. Two of them have become really wonderful friends that I have integrated into my circle of friends. One is on the search for a Filipino girl with colorful hair, and the other is in search for a fobby Asian girl, both types that are so not me. 

Another observation that I have made is that I have had the best connections with people from the Bay Area. Of the 14 people I have gone on dates with, I have had sex with 4 of them, and these 4 guys all happen to have grown up in the Bay Area, while the other 10 did not. I didn't notice this until this last week, and I think I just naturally gravitate towards NorCal people. 

RANDOM STORY
Pittsburgh A—I matched with a guy that looked really familiar. I sent his picture to my sister, and it turns out she had gone on a date with him too. We joked about how he took me to a nicer place, compared to a boba place, and just compared notes about how peculiar he was. Cute guy, but really odd. I could tell the waitress felt bad for me when he went on a Elon Musk rant. She tried interrupting many times. Thanks girlfriend. 

WORST DATE
Chicago M—This guy was very pleasant in his texts and asked me if I had any dating horror stories. I could honestly say that I didn't have any. On the date, he picks me up and gives me sunflowers. Yay! He even asks if he can hug me. I thought that was different and polite. Then, during the walking part of the date, he keeps trying to hold my hand and kiss me. I have to constantly let go of his hand and dodge his advances. He ends up missing and kissing my cheek instead. I tell him to stop, but he is still trying. I tell him that I'm tired and want to go home. As we stand outside his car and I go in for a goodbye hug, he grabs me by the shoulders so I can't move and goes for it. I push him away and tell him this is the worst date I have ever been on. He seems shocked and confused and says my eyes have been signaling to him that I want to be kissed. I wish him luck, tell him he should never do that again to a date, and just walk away. 

BEST DATE
San Jose B—We met up at my favorite bar and had cocktails, and connected on most levels. Attraction, Hobbies, Interests, Outlook on Life. I didn't feel the romantic connection, but I have figured out that I'm not someone who can instantly feel that way for someone. Anyways, we had really fun sex at my place, and now he's like my DnD tutor. He also wins small MTG tournaments *faints* We are planning on going raving soon. Even if a relationship does not form, he's definitely someone I want to remain in my life. 

In current conclusion, I’m having a blast but still really looking forward to meeting someone that makes me feel butterflies when I see him. Who knows, maybe I already know him, or maybe he’s coming up soon. :) 

Also, down to critique your profiles. I enjoyed the last batch.

&lt;p&gt;It was therapeutic and fun writing my last post, and visualizing my stats. Here’s an update on my current “sales funnel.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;52 Matches&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;31 Conversations &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14 First Dates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7 Second Dates &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6 Third Dates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0 Fourth Dates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson I have learned in the last month is that it&amp;#39;s okay and possible to simultaneously have fun hooking up, and searching for the one that makes you feel like inactivating your account. I am finding out that it&amp;#39;s not as easy to find this combination raver nerd that I originally thought, but the search has been fun so far. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have made a handful of good friends through this app, some of which that have become FWBs that I see regularly. Two of them have become really wonderful friends that I have integrated into my circle of friends.

,coffeemeetsbagel,"As I sit here in the busiest airport, I have been reflecting on my dating experience the last couple of months, and am trying to put together ideas for more productive dating. 

As a true dating noob, I want to share with you my 2 month experience on CMB in hopes it might help you or make you feel less alone in this dating process, or as my friends say “game”. -.-

**BACK STORY**

My profile was created July 2018 after having been single for 7 months, and after the end to a 2-year long relationship that ended amicably. Both the serious relationships I have been in have been with friends-turned-boyfriends. I have not dated a complete stranger before until CMB. 

I could not bring myself to actually put my profile together because it felt too awkward to talk about myself, so with the help of two guys and a girl friend, I have the below description with a main photo of me as a bridesmaid, EDC photo, Comic-Con with a Xenomorph, and my Ruth Bader Ginsburg Halloween costume. Overall, I think this profile has served me well because there are many wayw to start a conversation from the listed items. 

My preferences were set to 25 miles, all ethnicities, ages 28-35, and spiritual/non-religious.

**EXPERIENCE**

In my two months, here are my stats that I saved. As a sales manager, this looks like a standard sales funnel. No closing sale yet though! 

40 Matches

19 Actual Conversations

10 First Dates

5 Second Dates

4 Third Dates

**NOTABLE BAGELS**

Canadian A-Extremely funny profile that actually made me laugh out loud, and even funnier in person. We had three dates, but he was upfront that it would not work out because we had too little in common. I really liked this one, but on a positive note, he got me into Reddit. 

Chicago T-We had two dates and we both immediately felt the friend vibe. We are now legit friends that hang out and drink together on a weekly basis, and talk about dating strategy. I’m going to set him up with a friend of mine. 

Texas M-My accidental connection! His profile was shit awful and I accidentally clicked it my first day. I didn’t want to say OOOPS or ghost him, so I went with it. He was actually really cool and now I have a new member of my rave crew. We hung out just last week at Dreamstate. 

San Jose T -One official date. I fucked up and basically attacked him with sex after dinner. He’s a fantastic person, but now he has the mindset that I am looking for something more casual, which is actually not true. I just had a moment of weakness and went for it. I feel bad about this, and feel like I can't start over. 

Los Angeles A-Absolutely physically attracted to this guy, and have SO many interests in common, but felt no romantic chemistry between us. NOOOOOO! Hopefully, I can at least gain a friend out of this. 

**OBSERVATIONS**

About 90% of those that I matched with are guys NOT from the Bay Area. They moved here in their early to mid-twenties and work as engineers. Therefore, their networks are probably not as big as someone who grew up here. They struggled at first growing their friend groups and went to meet-ups to get started. I also noticed these bagels all live alone in a one-bedroom, which is nice for staying over of course! I think Bay Area people tend to live with friends or their parents. 

Some  guys I met with had just moved here, like a month or two ago! Honestly, I don’t think I can date someone that does not have their own group of friends first. Another hmmm moment is someone who could be moving away in a year, which has come up a few times. A lot of these transplant guys aren’t really digging the Bay Area culture and costs and would much prefer to move to Oregon or Seattle (hmmmmm). 

One guy moves to a different state every other year! Come on, man! Are you a serial killer? 

**PROFILE ADVICE FOR EVERYONE**

YES-Dog photos (always yes!), r*ecent* photos 

No-Group Photos (I think one is okay, just to show you have friends), boring descriptions, photos with you and someone that looks like could’ve been your SO

Try to stand out from the constant profile description of someone that likes biking, hiking, and traveling, and is looking for someone that’s honest, spontaneous, and authentic. Blegh. At least word it differently so it’s the same idea, but written in a more inique way. u

Really think about the distance in which you are willing to travel to see someone, with Bay Area traffic added!  Also, keep in mind the cost to dating. I have the problem of insisting on splitting the bill, and it’s starting to hurt. Now I am going to suggest cheap food and just walking around a park. 

I think it’s weird when someone asks to meet up after only a couple days of communication. Maybe if there was an immediate obvious chemistry that would make sense, but I really suggest seeing if you can carry on a 5 day conversation before meeting up.

**WHAT I WILL DO DIFFERENTLY**

1. Focus on friendship first and then go from there. Not rush myself into figuring out if someone has relationship potential. 
2. Still be the same blunt person, just less forthcoming. It's okay to hold back information. 

Just my two cents. I hope it wasn't a useless read. 

Now, off to board the plane! 

Thanks, and good luck!

,coffeemeetsbagel,"Hey everyone,

This is going to be blunt but I'm still very confused. I've been using coffee meets bagel for a couple of weeks now and in all this time I haven't had any girls in my 20+ suggestions a day that are even remotely as pretty as the girls I would usually date through traditional means. On the other hand my discovery section is full of quality women.

What gives? Is this a sign that CMB has been overtaken by corporate greed and are trying to push beans on me or is there more at play here? I'm in a well populated area (NYC) and totally willing to blame myself for this (be it profile description or photos). I'm aware that dating apps are going to be tougher for me because I present really well in person but quality of suggestions is -way- off. It just seems so tedious that I would ""like"" one girl every other week from my suggestions (half heartedly) and then have to play the odds of her liking back. At this rate I'm going to be married before CMB even opens a chat line with someone. 

Is the expected use for the app to just throw money at beans and play the numbers in the discovery section?

What have your experiences been like?
